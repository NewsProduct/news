'' todd allen , tina allen 's son , told cnn he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video . he said his mother and stiles spent time together there . todd allen said nobody realized the child may have been abused . `` she 's what you 'd expect a little girl in elementary school to be like , '' he said . he said he never witnessed stiles physically assault anyone . `` but i have seen him verbally and mentally assault many people , '' todd allen told cnn . looking back , tina allen said there were some warning signs . she said stiles hit her once but she did n't file a police report . she said she blames herself . `` how could i not know ? why could n't i have recognized something ? why are all these people going through this torture now because of me ? '' allen asked . allen ended her relationship with stiles a few months ago . she said she believes it will be difficult for police to find him . `` he will hide out in mountains if that 's what it takes , he will hide out in a crowd , he 'll find somebody who has n't heard anything and stay there , '' she said . `` he has skills . he knows how to hunt , i mean hunt with a gun , a knife , a bow . '' allen said stiles stopped by her house last week for a friendly visit before his name was linked to the videotape . she said his appearance had changed . she said his hair was longer and he had put on weight . stiles , a resident of pahrump , nevada , is a former animal trainer , authorities said . de meo said the fbi also is seeking him in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under 14 . the man who claimed to have found the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in sunday to nye county officials . darren tuck , a nevada resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police , faces a possible sentence of 10 years to life for exhibiting pornography and another one to six years for possession of child pornography , according to de meo . tuck 's attorney , harry kuehn , said last week on cnn 's `` nancy grace '' that his client had been `` wracked by indecision '' as to what to do with the tape once he realized what it was . e-mail to a friend .
265	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- during the 1960 presidential election , theodore sorensen helped then-sen . john f. kennedy draft a speech addressing kennedy 's catholicism and the separation between church and state . at the time , many questioned whether kennedy , who would go on to become the nation 's first roman catholic president , would be influenced by the catholic church . theodore sorensen helped write john f. kennedy 's 1960 speech on catholicism . speaking to cnn senior political analyst bill schneider , sorensen discussed kennedy 's famous 1960 speech and compared it to the speech on faith in politics delivered thursday by republican presidential candidate mitt romney , who would be the first mormon in the white house if he is elected . question : did kennedy 's 1960 speech win him the presidency ? sorensen : well , he obviously did n't lose it , nor did he free the country from the curse of anti-catholicism . the hate mail still poured into his office . the vicious picket signs were still seen out on the campaign trail , and , indeed , on election day . according to a university of michigan survey , more people voted against kennedy because of his religion than any other reason . nevertheless , that speech , which was nationally broadcast and frequently rebroadcast , certainly took a lot of the poison out of the anti-catholic issue and reassured all reasonable people . watch sorensen discuss why kennedy gave his speech '' q. could president kennedy have delivered the speech romney gave on thursday ? sorensen : no . mr. romney 's position on many of the issues are very different than jfk 's . jfk wanted to particularly stress that he believed in the separation between church and state . he believed that no one needed to worry about a catholic bishop or a cardinal dictating to him as a president , and that freedom of religion included freedom for those to go to any church or not to go to any church at all . so , romney emphasized the role of religion in public life more strongly than jfk did or would have . q. romney seemed to differ quite strongly with kennedy on the privacy of religion , did n't he ? sorensen : yes , he did . in fact , romney felt compelled for some reason to define his personal views of jesus christ . kennedy said , as you noted , his personal views of religion were totally his business and not the business of the american people . q. romney made the statement `` freedom requires religion just as religion requires freedom . '' do you think kennedy would have agreed with that ? sorensen : i do n't think anyone would disagree strongly with that . there were some lines in the romney speech that echoed the kennedy speech . as an old speechwriter , i would congratulate mr. romney . it was a pretty good speech . i think he touched all the bases he wanted to touch . q. romney discussed his views of jesus christ , something that kennedy avoided . why did kennedy avoid discussing his religious views ? sorensen : because -lsb- kennedy -rsb- began the speech by saying his private religious beliefs -- his relationship with god or jesus christ or anything else -- was not a matter of public discussion . he did not think the election should be based on -- as he said , it 's not what kind of church i believe in , the question is what kind of country do i believe in . q. kennedy 's speech in 1960 is widely viewed as being successful . do you think romney 's speech is likely to be viewed as a success ? sorensen : i assume so . i do n't think mr. romney should be denied the presidency because of his religion . just as i do n't think senator -lsb- barack -rsb- obama should be denied because of his race . or that mrs. -lsb- hillary -rsb- clinton should be denied the presidency because of her gender . this country is in deep , serious trouble , and thoughtful citizens surely are going to make up their minds based on the major issues confronting the country and the major qualities of the candidates and not on such superficial tests as religion , race , or gender . e-mail to a friend .
266	paris , france -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a major donors conference to raise funds for the palestinians has gone beyond expectations , with donors pledging $ 7.4 billion to help build a palestinian state , organizers said monday . france 's nicolas sarkoxy , left , welcomes tony blair and palestinian leader mahmoud abbas on monday . other delegations at the paris meeting are offering aid in kind , such as the international monetary fund , which said it would provide monitoring of the palestinians ' promised reforms to reassure donors that their money would be used efficiently . palestinian prime minister salam fayyad called the pledge of money a `` vote of confidence '' in the palestinians . former british prime minister tony blair said the support of donors needed to be repaid in the coming months with steps to create a lasting settlement . `` over the next few months , we have to show people our capability of making the difference on the ground , '' said blair , who co-hosted the conference in his new role as envoy for the so-called middle east quartet of the united nations , united states , european union and russia . the paris conference focuses on short-term priorities for the palestinians , and french president nicolas sarkozy said those include providing immediate support for the palestinian people -- particularly those living in gaza -- and stabilizing the palestinian economy . watch cnn 's jim bittermann explain the conference 's aims '' it follows on the heels of last month 's peace talks in the u.s. in which israeli and palestinian leaders vowed to negotiate a final-status agreement by the end of 2008 . french president nicolas sarkozy said france would donate $ 300 million , and the united states was expected to pledge more than $ 500 million . central to the palestinians ' request for aid is a three-year reform plan that the palestinians prepared for the conference . the plan , which covers 2008 to 2010 , centers on economic development and government reform . the world bank praised the plan , calling it a `` promising effort '' to link policy-making , planning and budgeting . but in a report released monday , the world bank pointed out the reforms would succeed in helping palestinians only if they were accompanied by both donor aid and israeli actions . israeli foreign minister tzipi livni spoke of taking such actions , saying israel is committed to meeting its responsibilities under the middle east road map , especially regarding the contentious issue of settlements . livni said an agreement had been reached with the european union to provide training for palestinian police . palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas said the palestinians did n't lack will or determination but resources . he promised donors that palestinians would work hard to create a modern country in control of its security . `` we are at a historic stage today , and the destiny of our region and peace depends on this , '' said abbas , who requested the conference be held . abbas earlier had requested $ 5.6 billion in aid over the next three years . sarkozy repeatedly told the conference he is a `` friend of israel , '' but he urged the israeli government to withdraw troops from the west bank , freeze settlements , reopen institutions in east jerusalem and help the isolated population of gaza . the world bank 's report detailed the challenges facing attempts to revive the palestinian economy , which has become almost totally dependent on foreign aid . the palestinian authority is the largest employer for its people , as private-sector jobs dry up . the world bank said wages for public sector employees account for almost half of the government 's expenditures . with public investment having nearly ceased , the world bank said , almost all government funds in the past two years have been used to pay salaries and cover operating costs . staffing also has gone up in the health and education sectors , the world bank said , leaving little money for pharmaceuticals , medical supplies , teaching and learning materials , and overall maintenance . the world bank said the reforms would only succeed if they include gaza , where 40 percent of the palestinian population lives . gaza has been subject to a wide-ranging crackdown since hamas took power in june ; its borders are closed , fuel imports are restricted , and there are strict limits on all imported goods . `` the continued entry of humanitarian goods has mitigated the impact of the closures on gaza 's population , but has not been sufficient to offset the collapse of the private sector there , '' the world bank report said . unemployment across the palestinian territories stands at nearly 23 percent , the world bank said , but in gaza , 33 percent of the population is out of a job . it predicted the figures would rise if the restrictions continue . a report monday from the u.n. development program spotlighted the pressures on private palestinian businesses , especially in gaza , where it said the private sector `` is on the verge of collapse with no scope for recovery '' unless israeli restrictions are lifted . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's jim bittermann contributed to this report .
267	atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- i was 14 at the time . lebanon 's civil war was in full flood . one afternoon the shells began raining down on our neighborhood in beirut . a lebanese woman and her son run through west beirut in 1989 during fighting between rival forces . we ran from school screaming . forget the book bags , classmates , homework . just run . out of breath , my knees giving way , it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter -- a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block . the memory of that terrifying afternoon receded -- until recently . after more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction , the bombings and assassinations have returned to beirut . every time i hear of a new explosion , i think of a frightened child sitting in darkness . in 1988 , i watched the last throes of lebanon 's civil war firsthand -- and like millions of lebanese , sad , frustrated and often fearful . see a timeline of lebanon 's recent history '' now i watch from another continent , but i find those same emotions resurfacing . the conspiracies , the car bombs , the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar . the actors are like shadows from a long gone past . they are grayer perhaps -- those who have avoided assassination . but the cast in lebanon 's tragedy has changed little in two decades . then , as now , a presidential election is the setting , and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set lebanon back 20 years . see bios of lebanon 's major players '' in 1988 , the president 's term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate . militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building . compromise was nowhere in sight . the west had abandoned lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors . syria had its choice for president ; israel had its own allies -- a foil for growing muslim radicalism . the country was awash with weapons . in his last act as president , amin gemayel named fellow christian and army chief michel aoun as prime minister . at a stroke , he shattered the convention that a muslim hold that position . muslims refused to serve in the cabinet and the country ended up with two governments . aoun famously declared : `` i am prime minister and six ministers in one . '' aoun 's `` war of liberation '' against syria turned into defeat . then , he turned on fellow christians of the lebanese forces in the `` war of elimination . '' when that failed , the syrians drove aoun to take refuge at the french embassy . in august 1990 , i came to cnn as a world report panelist . i tried to explain lebanon 's chaos , the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians . i had seen people killed in front of me ; children orphaned in seconds , parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins . so when i was offered the opportunity to stay at cnn , i gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy . but almost as i left , the civil war was being laid to rest . the various factions had fought each other to a standstill ; arab governments , supported by the west , helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by syrian influence . peace came to lebanon , but it would be five years before i returned . in 1995 , i went back and was stunned . i kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants . i could n't believe that i could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another . no longer did identity -- christian , muslim or druze -- define where lebanese could go . people mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubble-bubble , laughing at the same jokes . it was as if lebanon 's divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser . downtown beirut , once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes , was rocking to lebanese pop music . the dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest european fashions and deluxe hotels . lovers had returned to beirut 's corniche , overlooking the mediterranean , for romantic strolls at sunset . but the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement -- and was overseen by a `` pax syriana . '' as anti-syrian sentiment grew , so did political tensions . on valentine 's day 2005 , the corniche was once again rocked by an explosion . former prime minister rafik hariri was killed . the symbolism left me speechless . on the day of love , lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history . it had been widely expected that hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of syrian troops . suspicion fell on damascus , which vehemently denied involvement . on march 14 , martyrs ' square became a human sea of demonstrators : muslims , druze and christians alike , demanding the `` truth . '' but hariri 's death also exposed the fault lines that had broken lebanon a generation previously . even after it withdrew its troops , syria still had allies in lebanon . one was hezbollah , accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of u.s. marines in beirut more than 20 years previously . another was gen. michel aoun ; now back from exile , the same michel aoun who had defied syria in 1989 , but who now made common cause with hezbollah against his fellow christians . earlier this year i visited martyrs ' square . the spirit of the cedar revolution had evaporated . the place looked like a morgue . anti-government hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill . as i passed through , business owners stood silent in the sun and shook their heads at me in despair . i wondered if they sensed my disappointment , my pain at watching beirut bleed again . lebanon 's political actors now find themselves re-enacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago . once again , the term of the president is approaching its end ; there is no agreement on his successor . suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day . and the questions haunts me : will the country 's brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries ? e-mail to a friend . cnn 's joe sterling , david ariosto , saad abedine and tracy doueiry contributed to this report .

270	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- kenya has enjoyed a reputation as one of east africa 's most stable nations since achieving independence from the uk in 1963 . residents of the mathare slum in nairobi shout at demonstrators during violent clashes . but a booming tourism industry , impressive economic growth -- currently six percent a year according to the economist -- and decades of peace in a region scarred by conflict have served to disguise widespread poverty , violent crime and corruption and simmering ethnic tensions . tribal bonds remain stronger than national identity in kenya , with the country 's 36 million people claiming allegiance to around 40 different tribes . last week 's election pitched incumbent president mwai kibaki , a member of kenya 's largest kikuyu tribe , against opposition leader raila odinga of the luo tribe . the kikuyu make up about 22 percent of kenya 's population . mostly originating from kenya 's central highlands , the kikuyu have long wielded strong economic and political power within the country . kenya 's first post-independence leader , jomo kenyatta , president from 1964 until 1978 , was a kikuyu . kibaki , a government minister from 1965 until winning power as head of the party of national unity in elections five years ago , also enjoys the support of kenyatta 's successor , daniel arap moi , a member of the kalenjin tribe who ruled kenya for 24 years from 1978 to 2002 . the luo make up around 13 percent of the population , mostly in the west of the country . but they also form a sizeable community in some of nairobi 's most notorious slums , such as the vast kibera shantytown where odinga enjoys strong support and where some of this week 's fiercest violence has occurred . odinga 's orange democratic movement is also backed by many members of the luhya tribe , kenya 's second largest ethnic group , after odinga promised to make a leading luhya his deputy if elected . this week 's violence came as election officials declared victory for kibaki with 51.3 percent to 48.7 percent for odinga in the closest presidential vote in kenyan electoral history . but the result has been questioned by international election observers , throwing the country 's political future into doubt . kibaki 's first election success in 2002 -- declared free and fair by international observers -- was hailed at the time as a step forward for kenyan democracy . however , his term has been dogged by allegations of corruption and graft . e-mail to a friend .

272	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- in the days after benazir bhutto 's assassination , it will be tempting to reach two hasty conclusions : that she was pakistan 's last great hope and that her geo-politically crucial country has revealed itself to be inherently hopeless . irshad manji is a controversial muslim feminist and activist from toronto , canada . on each front , i take a different view . while far more liberal and democratic than gen. musharraf , bhutto disappointed moderate , modern pakistanis with her adherence to feudal politics . writing to me through my web site , american feminists say they are `` aching '' over the loss of `` our dear , sweet , brave benazir . '' i understand the sentiment . but `` brave '' is not the word used by pakistani women from whom i 've also heard . they 're hurting more over bhutto 's `` self-imposed '' conformity . `` she never realized her potential , '' a woman from karachi tells me . `` and not because she was killed but because when she had the chance , she did not effectively challenge the backward mindset that has now led to her demise . '' for example , during bhutto 's time in office , pakistan did n't defy the anti-female rape and adultery laws . those notorious ordinances , known as hudood , took their inspiration from tribal politics masquerading as islam . watch manji argue on cnn why bhutto 's legacy is mixed '' imagine the opportunity : bhutto could have championed a purer faith by tackling corrupt cultural practices . in so doing , she might have created allies among conservatives , who can be persuaded that although islam is god-given , culture is man-made . last year , a media campaign to strike down the hudood ordinances achieved this fine balance . but not because of her . and that , say many progressive pakistanis , amputates bhutto 's legacy . the fact that cruel laws against women can be publicly debated at all should suggest that pakistan has hope anyway . an exceptional leader can tap into it . history tells us so . there was a time when pakistan 's democratic politicians stuck it to the feudal fanatics . bhutto 's father , zulfikar ali bhutto , was once heckled by a religious fundamentalist . `` you drink alcohol ! '' shouted the critic . `` yes , '' retorted the elder bhutto , `` but i do n't drink the blood of the people !

'' jinnah meant every word of his unconventional vision because he , himself , lived as a maverick . he adored his non-muslim wife , and his sister often appeared with him on the campaign trail . her visibility attested to islam 's embrace of women as partners of men . in the months ahead , the people of pakistan will need to recall jinnah 's vision . it may be of comfort know that they 're not alone . countless americans are now asking about their founders ' intentions , desperate to re-discover the better angels of their country after eight years of george w. bush . still , pakistan must avoid america 's enduring mistake . the united states lapsed into profound divisiveness following the assassinations of martin luther king jr. and robert f. kennedy . many would argue that today 's politics of polarization can be traced to the unresolved trauma of the king-kennedy murders . for pakistan , it 's high time to transcend both trauma and tribalism . i pray that in death , benazir bhutto will be the catalyst for a deeper democracy than she ever advocated in life . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer . e-mail to a friend .

274	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- claims by diana 's former butler that he knew a mysterious `` secret '' about the late princess have been trashed by the coroner in her inquest . diana 's former butler has given conflicting information at the enquiry into her death . the coroner said the information was already in the public domain and some of it was even mentioned in one of paul burrell 's own books . considered the first star witness of the inquest , burrell 's appearance tuesday was delayed after the coroner asked him to retrieve the last letter the princess gave him . monday , the ex-butler -- once described by the princess as `` her rock '' -- told the inquest the letter contained a `` secret , '' which he claimed he could not remember . after returning to london from his home in northern england tuesday , burrell said the letter was not there , but at his home in florida . he then handed the coroner a note that he said contained the supposed secret . the coroner revealed that what burrell referred to was that diana was planning to buy property to live in part of the time and that the location may have been in the united states or south africa . the coroner said the revelation is `` fairly and squarely in the public domain '' and that some of the information appeared in burrell 's book `` the way we were . '' explaining the apparent discrepancies in his testimony , burrell said he was confused by the cross-examination , which he described as `` horrid '' and `` disgraceful . '' the questioning of the former butler is expected to continue wednesday . diana and her boyfriend , dodi fayed , died in a paris tunnel in the early hours of august 31 , 1997 , along with their driver , henri paul . they had driven away from the ritz hotel in a black mercedes with paparazzi chasing behind . there has been speculation that the couple had planned a big announcement the night they died . photographers have testified they had heard rumors diana would say she was getting engaged to fayed or having a baby . watch report on claims about diana 's marriage plans '' burrell did not take the stand until tuesday afternoon . earlier in the day , the inquest heard from diana 's former lawyer , who said the princess had claimed queen elizabeth was planning to abdicate in april 1996 and allow prince charles to be king . maggie rae said at the inquest that diana also believed there was a plot to seriously injure her in an accident . rae said the claims came at a meeting with her legal team at kensington palace in which the princess also made clear her belief that the succession of the english crown should skip a generation to her son , william . the morning 's evidence also heard that britain 's top police officer had advised the queen against allowing diana to go on holiday with mohamed al fayed , the father of dodi . in a note from chief superintendent dai davies , head of the royal protection squad , that was read out to the court , it was stated that he and metropolitan police commissioner sir paul condon believed that the planned holiday was `` unwise . '' al fayed -- a successful businessman and owner of the london luxury store harrods -- was considered a controversial figure at the time . diana defied the advice and went on the trip . it was during this holiday on the tycoon 's luxury yacht in the french resort of st. tropez that she met dodi fayed . during her testimony , rae also gave an insight into the princess 's lifestyle , which she described as `` odd '' and `` lonely . '' she said she did not believe diana 's claims of a conspiracy against her . `` i remember one occasion when she told me about her weekend and she had been alone in those rather silent set of apartments . she had heated her own food in the microwave , '' rae told the court . `` i thought she lived in a very odd environment . i thought she was quite lonely .

275	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- princess diana 's relationships with two muslim men provoked an outburst from her mother , who called her daughter `` a whore '' , paul burrell , the princess 's former butler , told an inquest monday . diana once referred to her former butler paul burrell as `` my rock . '' burrell , who returned to britain from his home in florida to give evidence , was the first star witness of the london inquest , now in its fourth month . his role as confidant to diana , who died in a paris car crash on august 31 , 1997 , along with her boyfriend dodi fayed and hotel security chief henri paul , meant his testimony was eagerly anticipated . burrell , whom the late princess once called `` my rock , '' cast doubt on whether diana was ready to marry fayed . according to burrell , the princess was still `` holding a candle '' for former boyfriend and heart surgeon hasnat khan -- who she called `` her soulmate '' -- when she started dating fayed `` on the rebound . '' burrell told the inquest that diana asked him to listen in on a conversation in june 1997 with her mother , frances shand kydd , who died in 2004 and who was critical of her relationship with muslim men . `` she called the princess a ` whore ' and she said that she was messing around with ` effing muslim men ' and she was ` disgraceful ' and said some very nasty things , '' burrell said . he agreed that , as a result of such calls diana , decided not to talk to her mother again . the inquest , which began in october and is expected to last another two or three months , aims to uncover the facts surrounding the deaths of the princess and dodi and determine their cause of death -- whether by accident or otherwise . asked earlier in the day if he believed that fayed was `` the one , '' burrell said `` no , i did not have that impression . '' he also cast doubt on claims that fayed and diana were engaged or on the cusp of engagement , saying : `` i find that difficult to believe . '' asked to explain himself , burrell said : `` because this was only a 30-day relationship and the princess had just finished a long-term relationship with someone -lrb- khan -rrb- she cared deeply about . i knew that because i was there and i saw it . '' diana 's 18-month relationship with khan ended around the same time she started seeing fayed in july 1997 . burrell said diana had asked him at one point to investigate how a private wedding with khan might take place , given that khan is muslim . watch report on claims about diana 's marriage plans . '' khan had not proposed to the princess , burrell said , adding that khan was `` the man she loved more than any other . '' he said he spoke to diana about the possibility that fayed would give her a ring shortly before her death . burrell said he suggested to the princess that she wear it on the fourth finger of her right hand , rather than the left , as is customary with engagement rings . `` i need marriage like a bad rash , '' burrell claimed diana told him . last month at the inquest lady annabel goldsmith , a friend of diana , said the princess had remarked that she needed another marriage `` like a rash on my face . '' burrell also indicated that the ring was not an engagement ring , as the fayed family has maintained . fayed family spokesman michael cole testified last week that dodi 's father , mohamed al fayed , was certain the couple had planned to marry . lawyers at the inquest asked burrell whether he knew whether a special announcement had been planned for the monday following the fatal car crash . there has been speculation the couple planned to announce special news , such as an engagement . but burrell said he knew nothing of such a plan . he said he had actually looked at diana 's schedule for that day and found only mundane items , and nothing to indicate she planned a special announcement . burrell also told the inquest he did not believe prince philip , queen elizabeth 's , husband was involved in diana 's death . mohamed al fayed , father of dodi and the owner of harrods department store , has long claimed that senior members of the royal family -- specifically the queen 's husband , prince philip -- ordered the pair be murdered . he also claims that diana was pregnant at the time of her death . but burrell said that he knew prince philip very well and that he could not have been behind the deaths . `` i can tell you that is not prince philip 's nature , '' he said . `` plus the princess was the mother of his grandchildren . why would he want to harm her ? it 's not possible . '' the inquest has seen and heard about correspondence which prince philip sent to diana , with some witnesses claiming that he wrote cruel and hurtful letters . but other correspondence shown to the jury appeared to be friendly and was affectionately signed , `` pa. '' burrell explained that philip could sometimes come across as terse because he says what he thinks . `` prince philip does n't mix his words , '' burrell said . `` he says it as it is , but he is not a nasty man . prince philip is n't known for his diplomacy . he was fond of the princess . '' burrell worked for the british royals for 21 years and became close to diana after her separation from prince charles . he has written two books about his time with the princess . in his second book , burrell told of a letter from diana which indicated she feared for her life . the princess wrote that prince charles planned '' ` an accident ' in my car , brake failure and serious head injury . '' one of diana 's close friends , however , testified last month that she believed the letter could have been forged . lucia flecha de lima said on december 18 that burrell was capable of imitating the princess 's handwriting . lawyers questioned burrell about the date of the letter . burrell said it was written in october 1996 , two months , after diana and charles divorced -- yet the letter refers to charles as `` my husband . '' burrell responded that diana always referred to charles that way , even after the divorce . the inquest has revealed that diana was a prolific letter-writer who also received a lot of correspondence . witnesses , including burrell , recall that the princess kept the letters in her desk , with the more important ones stored in a special box . burrell testified that after diana 's death , her mother , frances shand-kidd , worked every day for a week shredding the papers from diana 's desk . he said he expressed concern about the shredding during a meeting he had with the queen on december 19 , 1997 . it was at this meeting that queen elizabeth told burrell : `` there are powers at work in this country about which we have no knowledge . '' that comment , which has been widely reported , was meant to warn him to be careful , burrell said , and was not a warning about any one person or group of people . at the same meeting burrell also told the queen that he had taken some of diana 's belongings to keep safe . the details of the conversation emerged when burrell stood trial for their alleged theft in 2002 , causing the case against him to collapse . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's emily chang and heidi berger contributed to this report .

'' but reid said democrats would continue pushing to shift federal tax breaks away from fossil-fuel producers and into renewable energy research -- one of the party 's top priorities when it took control of congress in january . house opponents such as rep. joe barton , r-texas , complained that the bill will undo many of the efforts made to foster increased production of fossil fuels in an energy bill passed in 2005 . `` i understand the consequences of elections . i understand there 's a new majority , '' said barton , the ranking republican on the house committee on energy and commerce . `` i do not understand how what made sense two years ago does n't make sense today .

'' dominguez said he used branches and sticks to spell out the word `` help '' near the culvert , where the three slept the last two nights -- at times sleeping with their feet inside each other 's shirts to help stave off frostbite . he said his daughter was the first to hear a california highway patrol helicopter overhead . he said he ran though several feet of snow barefooted to wave it down . `` when they turned around , man , i was just praising god and saying , ` thank you lord , thank you lord , ' because i knew we had made it , '' he said . police vehicles equipped with snow chains rumbled up mountain roads to help conduct the search , which also involved a snowmobile and dogs . more than 80 searchers scoured the woods wednesday until the four were found about 1 p.m. -lrb- 4 p.m. et -rrb- . officer steve ward said he was piloting the helicopter out ahead of bad weather when he spotted dominguez coming out of the culvert and waving . `` we were very lucky that we just saw this guy at the last second . '' paramedic flight officer dave white , who was with ward , said that after the two shut down the helicopter and waved the family over , all four came running . `` the little girl was in tears , '' he said . white said the family was found north of where ground crews were searching . the pilots could see the `` help '' sign they had made with twigs on a nearby four-wheel-drive road , he said . christopher dominguez told cnn 's anderson cooper the family got lost sunday searching for a tree , which they had chopped down but later abandoned . he said they did n't have food , heavy coats or other provisions to help prepare for the cold nights . `` we were n't prepared at all , '' he said . `` we just thought we were going to go up to the mountains , get our tree and go back home . it did n't turn out that way . '' after the family failed to locate their vehicle , he said , snow and darkness began to fall . at that point , lexi dominguez said , `` i started freaking out . '' `` it was really , really scary , '' she said . `` i just remember walking and walking and being like , we 're not going to make it , '' lexi said . and as they huddled for warmth , christopher dominguez said , his sister sang songs to help pass the time until help arrived . `` we were all just happy , happy to be rescued , '' christopher dominguez said late wednesday , huddled with his siblings under blankets in their home . `` i feel good , just happy to be home , '' said joshua dominguez . `` because i did n't think we were going to make it .

'' the search riveted those in paradise and beyond . mayor alan white , whose son played soccer on the same team as joshua last year , said he and many others in and around paradise have cut christmas trees in the same place where the family vanished . when winter weather sours there , he said , people in the woods can get lost quickly . `` if you 're 50 feet from your car , you might not be able to find it , '' he said . although police found the family 's car , it offered no clues as to where they might have gone . the inaccessible area is beyond the reach of cell phones , authorities have said . paradise high principal mike lerch said students had volunteered to help in the search . `` this is a good family , '' he said . christopher dominguez had graduated from the school a few months ago , lerch said , and lexi is a sophomore there . joshua attends paradise intermediate school . e-mail to a friend .
283	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the death of a passenger last week aboard an american airlines flight underscores the importance of taking precautions before flying , a travel health industry representative said monday . an american airlines passenger complaining that she was having trouble breathing died on a flight last week . jill drake , a marketing representative for medaire , inc. , said its physicians last year advised 74 airlines on how to handle more than 17,000 in-flight medical events . flight attendants with sick passengers call good samaritan hospital in phoenix , arizona , a level-one trauma center where emergency room physicians and a service able to translate 140 languages are on call to answer questions from any of 2 million airline passengers flying at any given time , she said . `` very rarely '' does the call result in a diversion , a decision made not by the doctor but by the pilot who must consider a number of variables beyond the passenger 's health , she said . the pilot must weigh weather conditions , remaining fuel and proximity to an airport . as of 1 p.m. -lrb- 3 p.m. et -rrb- monday , medaire had fielded 110 calls , `` which is a very busy day for us , '' she said . on average , the company gets about 50 in-flight calls from commercial airliners for an entire day , and an additional 25 or 30 calls related to events that occur at airport gates or aboard yachts and commercial ships , she said . airlines contracting with medaire include continental , southwest and british airways . american has its own in-house medical team . drake said medaire 's doctors documented 97 onboard deaths in 2007 , down from 110 in 2006 . the top categories of in-flight illness are fainting , gastrointestinal problems , respiratory issues such as shortness of breath , heart problems ranging from arrhythmias to arrest and orthopedic problems , such as broken bones , drake said . by law , u.s.-based commercial airlines must carry automatic external defibrillators , oxygen and medical kits . some airlines choose to carry extra , non-mandated medications . if a passenger already has breathing problems , airplane travel will only worsen the condition because cabins are typically pressurized at 8,000 feet , said drake . her advice to anyone not feeling 100 percent : `` do not travel . '' and anyone with a medical condition who travels should pack any critical medications in a carry-on bag , she said . though flight attendants are trained to handle on-board emergencies , `` they are not medically trained , '' she said . `` to think that they are going to be able to assist your every need , that 's quite a high expectation . '' hydration and moderation are key , and passengers should carry water and a snack , she said . vacationers often return home from tropical locales sunburned and , in some cases , drunk . `` altitude amplifies the buzz , '' drake said . `` you have a couple of cocktails in denver , you feel it a little bit more than in omaha . '' denver 's altitude is 5,280 feet ; omaha 's is 1,040 feet . flying in a fresh cast can also prove dangerous . `` your arm could expand and it could cut off your circulation , '' she said , noting that the risk is reduced with older casts , which have typically already expanded to accommodate any swelling . though the faa began demanding that airlines carry certain medications more than 30 years ago , the list was tiny . during the 1990s , overseas airlines began carrying more sophisticated equipment , and pressure increased for u.s.-based airlines to follow , said dr. russell rayman , executive director of the aerospace medical association , which has roughly 3,000 members including physicians , research scientists and flight nurses . congress held hearings and then required airlines carry more robust kits and defibrillators by 2004 . american airlines was among the first to do so , said dr. david mckenas , who served for 10 years as the airline 's corporate medical director until 2002 . he lauded the defibrillator as `` so good it 's like 100 cardiologists in a box . '' the machine will only work if the patient 's heart is fibrillating , a condition where the contractions become so irregular it loses its ability to pump blood efficiently . american airlines buys its kits from banyan international corp. , which describes itself as `` the nation 's leading provider of emergency medical kits . '' each of the nine-pound , $ 250 kits includes aspirin , alcohol swabs , nitroglycerine tablets , antihistamines , iv tubing , a stethoscope , a blood-pressure gauge , a bronchodilator , syringes , gloves , saline solution , epinephrine , dextrose , a manual resuscitation bag , alcohol pads and shears . oxygen comes in several forms aboard planes . the oxygen that flows into masks stored above individual seats is not medical oxygen and would not suffice for a passenger in an in-flight medical emergency , said rayman . flight attendants have portable bottles of oxygen that they are to use for themselves in the event of a cabin decompression . `` it could be used if there is a medical emergency on board , but that 's not its purpose , '' he said . more oxygen is stored in the cockpit for the pilots . though medaire keeps track of its clients ' medical air incidents , rayman criticized the faa 's failure to do so . `` there is no central repository where these things can be archived and then retrieved , '' he said . `` they do n't want to report it because it just does n't look good . it 's not good p.r. , you could say . '' he said even an anonymous registry would serve a useful purpose . `` we 're concerned for safety on the flight , '' faa spokeswoman alison duquette said . `` once someone leaves the aviation system , there is no way for us to track the outcome .

284	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the sole survivor of the crash that killed princess diana has told a court he still can not remember the incident but does not support the conspiracy theories surrounding it . bodyguard trevor rees and the back of princess diana 's head are seen shortly before the car crash . bodyguard trevor rees , formerly known as trevor rees-jones , was the front-seat passenger in the mercedes that carried diana , her boyfriend , dodi fayed , and their driver , henri paul . he sustained serious injuries in the august 31 , 1997 crash and testified that he received anonymous phone calls and letters after the accident , threatening him to keep quiet . he said the caller told him to keep quiet , saying , `` we know who you are , we know where you are , and we know where you live . '' rees said he did n't take the calls or letters seriously . a lawyer also asked rees about a supposed encounter with a woman in which he told her , `` if i remember , they 're going to kill me . '' rees said he did n't recall the conversation and found it unlikely he ever made the remark . rees , who still has a visible scar from the accident over his left eye , told the court he remembers nothing new about the crash , which , he has said , was an accident . he has said the last thing he remembers that night was leaving the ritz hotel in paris , and that his next memory is more than a week later , in his hospital bed , when his parents told him everyone else in the car was dead . rees suffered major injuries to his lower jaw , the base of his brain , and his pulmonary system and has had several surgeries and hospitalizations , some of which al fayed paid for . rees also testified that he did not support the allegations by dodi fayed 's father , mohamed al fayed , that british security services were behind the crash . he denied the security services paid him to change his story . at the time of the crash , rees was working for al fayed 's security team and was assigned to guard dodi fayed . he was also protecting the princess because she was fayed 's companion on the trip . he no longer works on al fayed 's security team . rees has said what was once a good relationship with his former employer has broken down , largely because he does into support al fayed 's conspiracy theories about the crash . `` i am not a part of any conspiracy to suppress the truth at all , '' rees testified . `` all i have ever done is given the truth as i see it . '' in 2000 , rees published a book , `` the bodyguard 's story : diana , the crash , and the sole survivor , '' offering his account of the events surrounding the crash . he said al fayed tried unsuccessfully to stop the book 's publication in england . rees told cnn he wrote the book to give a definitive account of what he remembered and knew , but also to counter al fayed 's accusations that his unprofessionalism caused the accident . rees also said proceeds from the book helped pay his legal bills . during the morning session , rees testified that he had two flashbacks in the months after the crash , but his psychiatrist told him they were false memories . in the first , rees said , he recalled hearing the voice of a woman -- apparently diana -- calling out , `` dodi '' from the back seat of the car . in the second flashback , rees said he recalled seeing a paparazzi motorbike next to the car . lawyer ian burnett then read from a letter written by al fayed to lord stevens , who investigated the crash for the british police . in the letter , al fayed says rees is lying about losing his memory . `` he knows the detail which the security services are so eager to suppress , '' al fayed wrote , alluding to his belief that the crash was part of a murder plot . rees testified that he was not lying about his memory loss : `` i have no memory of -- after leaving the back of the hotel , that 's my last true memory . '' rees also said claims the couple visited a jeweler 's in monte carlo to buy an engagement ring in late august 1997 were untrue . british authorities hold an inquest whenever someone dies in suspicious circumstances . a judge , who is also called a coroner , holds hearings to determine how the person died , but he will not determine blame or apportion guilt . although diana and dodi fayed died in paris , a british coroner must still investigate because their bodies were returned to britain . the inquest does not involve driver henri paul because his body remained in france . british authorities had to wait to begin the inquest until after french authorities concluded their investigation , which lasted from august 1997 to late 2003 . the inquest then began but immediately adjourned so that british police could do their own report , which was needed for the british inquest . the british police inquiry took almost three years and concluded in december 2006 . the inquest then resumed in october 2007 and is expected to last four to six months . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's teresa martini contributed to this report .

'' he has said he welcomes an international investigation . musharraf , who seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 , rejected criticism that his government did not do enough to provide security to bhutto , who was seeking to regain the post of prime minister . he noted that she had already survived one assassination attempt and `` was given more security than any other person . '' asked about the hunt for al qaeda leader osama bin laden , widely rumored to be in the remote border region between pakistan and afghanistan , musharraf said , `` there is no proof whatsoever that he 's here . we are not particularly looking for him , but we are operating against this -- and al qaeda and militant taliban . and in the process , obviously , it is combined . maybe we are looking for him also . '' and pakistan 's ambassador to the united states , mahmud ali durrani , told cnn 's `` late edition with wolf blitzer '' that , `` if we knew where he was , we would have taken him out . '' durrani added that musharraf 's comment about `` not specifically looking for osama '' means that the pakistani military is `` totally focused on destroying al qaeda and the taliban network and not just one person . '' about bhutto 's death , he noted only that the investigation is not completed `` and we should not jump to conclusions . '' still , he added , `` if she had not come out of the vehicle , the protected and armored vehicle , maybe we would have seen her smiling face again today .

'' the new york times reported sunday that the bush administration is considering expanding covert operations in the western part of pakistan to shore up support for musharraf 's government and to find bin laden and his second in command , ayman al-zawahiri . democratic presidential candidate bill richardson of new mexico told cnn 's `` late edition with wolf blitzer '' that , though he had not heard details of the plan , `` it sounds like a strategy that makes sense . '' he added , `` we have got to take whatever action is needed . '' richardson has called for musharraf to step down and has called for free and fair elections . `` what we need to do is ask musharraf , push him , push him to step aside for the good of the country , because he is widely unpopular , '' he told cnn . sen. hillary clinton , a democratic presidential candidate from new york , said saturday that she would try to persuade musharraf to share the responsibility for safeguarding his country 's nuclear weapons with a delegation from the united states and perhaps great britain . meanwhile , detectives from britain 's scotland yard on sunday once again examined the white land cruiser that bhutto was riding in when she was assassinated , pakistan 's state-run news agency said . the associated press of pakistan said the detectives also watched videos of bhutto 's last moments three times , and looked at bird 's eye view photographs of liaqat bagh park taken from a building that overlooks the rawalpindi public site . the team of five detectives arrived in pakistan friday after musharraf agreed they should work alongside pakistani agencies to determine how bhutto was killed and who was responsible for her death . on saturday , the team spent more than two hours at the park . musharraf said he expected the scotland yard investigators to help `` solve all the confusion '' surrounding the case . bhutto 's husband , asif ali zardari , wants a united nations inquiry into his late wife 's assassination . the pakistan interior ministry say the former leader died when she hit her head on the lever of her car 's sunroof after ducking for cover after a suicide bomb attack on her convoy . however , supporters of bhutto insist she was shot prior to the explosion -- a view that some say is supported by video footage of the moments before the blast . e-mail to a friend .

'' `` m '' is the child at the center of a long-running custody dispute between james and lia boldt , who divorced in 1999 . soon after , the father began studying judaism and later converted . he also started teaching his son about the faith . by then , james had parental custody and told his ex-wife the boy would convert as well , and that to do so , he would have to have the circumcision procedure . the mother objected , saying the child had been raised in the russian orthodox faith while the couple was married . because the two sides disagreed , and were living in neighboring states , the conflict dissolved into ongoing personal and constitutional dispute . james boldt said that as a jew and the primary caregiver , he has a first amendment right to practice his faith as he sees fit for his child . lia boldt countered her son does not want to go through with the circumcision , and that it is an invasive , irreversible , and potentially dangerous medical procedure . the state high court seemed especially reluctant to address the issue , saying normally such disputes `` are considered private family matters . '' but the justices noted `` these parties can not or will not resolve this matter without resort to the courts . '' so rather than offer a definitive ruling , the justices ordered both sides to go to the actual source of the conflict . `` in our view , at age 12 , m 's attitude regarding circumcision , though not conclusive of the custody issue presented here , is a fact necessary to the determination '' of whether the mother can press her objections to the procedure , wrote chief justice paul de muniz for the six-member panel . `` forcing m at age 12 to undergo circumcision against his will could seriously affect the relationship between m and his father , and could have a pronounced effect on father 's capability to properly care for m.

'' the cole was badly damaged by an al qaeda bombing during a port call in yemen in 2000 , killing 17 sailors . it returned to service in 2002 . the destroyer and two support ships are close to lebanon but out of visual range of the coast , pentagon officials said . another six vessels , led by the amphibious assault ship uss nassau , are close to italy and steaming toward the other three , the officials said . mullen would not say whether the deployment has anything to do with the upcoming lebanese parliamentary vote on a new president , which was postponed for a 15th time earlier this week . but he said the vote was `` important , '' and washington was waiting for it to take place . and a bush administration official told cnn the decision to move ships to the region was a message to neighboringsyria that `` the u.s. is concerned about the situation in lebanon , and we want to see the situation resolved . '' `` we are sending a clear message for the need for stability , '' said the official , who was not authorized to speak for publication . the ships `` should be there a while , '' the official added . lebanon 's pro-western majority in parliament and the pro-syrian opposition have battled for power over the last three years . the country has been without a president since november , when pro-syrian leader emile lahoud 's term expired and parliament was unable to agree on a replacement . despite general agreement among the factions to award the post to army chief gen. michel suleiman , disagreements over how to share power in a future cabinet have kept the issue from coming up for a vote . parliament speaker nabih berri 's office announced tuesday that the next planned session has been pushed back to march 11 . berri 's office said the arab league needed more time to break the deadlock . lebanon has been wracked by a sometimes-violent power struggle since the 2005 assassination of former prime minister rafik hariri , whose supporters blamed damascus for his killing . the resulting outcry eventually drove syrian forces out of lebanon , where they had been stationed since the 1970s . e-mail to a friend . cnn correspondent zain verjee contributed to this report .

'' the clashes began when authorities used force to clear freedom square of thousands of demonstrators who had camped there for the past 10 days , according to a u.s. embassy official . ghazarian said the authorities `` moved in '' because `` they thought that there were arms there , and it turned out that they were right . '' watch a report on clashes between police and the opposition '' the embassy official estimated that the demonstrations in freedom square grew to as many as 60,000 armenians at times over the last 10 days . as of early sunday morning , freedom square was empty , ghazarian said , but the protesters were demonstrating in a main square elsewhere in the city . watch ghazarian discuss the situation in armenia '' `` what is happening on the streets of yerevan is people protesting what they consider to be unfair elections , '' ghazarian said . `` after the president was forced to declare a state of emergency , things have quieted down . there are a couple of burning cars , and there are a few hurt people , '' she said . `` we 're convinced that this will come to an end soon . '' she did not elaborate on the number of people injured or the extent of their injuries . witnesses told cnn that saturday morning 's action by armenian riot police was bloody , but the u.s. official said there were no confirmed deaths or serious injuries . an armenian woman interviewed by cnn said there was `` huge chaos '' when police moved in . `` these are innocent people , '' she said . `` they just want their freedom . they just want to be heard . they are being beaten up , some people have horrible wounds .

294	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- saddam hussein let the world think he had weapons of mass destruction to intimidate iran and prevent the country from attacking iraq , according to an fbi agent who interviewed the dictator after his 2003 capture . iraqi leader saddam hussein in an unknown location in iraq after his capture in 2003 . according to a cbs report , hussein claimed he did n't anticipate that the united states would invade iraq over wmd , agent george piro said on `` 60 minutes , '' scheduled for sunday broadcast . `` for him , it was critical that he was seen as still the strong , defiant saddam . he thought that -lrb- faking having the weapons -rrb- would prevent the iranians from reinvading iraq , '' said piro . during the nearly seven months piro talked to hussein , the agent hinted to the iraqi that he answered directly to president bush , cbs said in a posting on its web site . `` he told me he initially miscalculated ... president bush 's intentions . he thought the united states would retaliate with the same type of attack as we did in 1998 ... a four-day aerial attack , '' piro said . `` he survived that one and he was willing to accept that type of attack . '' `` he did n't believe the u.s. would invade ? '' correspondent scott pelley asked . `` no , not initially , '' piro answered . once it was clear that an invasion was imminent , hussein asked his generals to hold off the allied forces for two weeks , piro said . `` and at that point , it would go into what he called the secret war , '' the agent said , referring to the insurgency . but piro said he was not sure that the insurgency was indeed part of hussein 's plan . `` well , he would like to take credit for the insurgency , '' he said . hussein had the ability to restart the weapons program and professed to wanting to do that , piro said . `` he wanted to pursue all of wmd ... to reconstitute his entire wmd program . '' hussein said he was proud he eluded u.s. authorities who searched for him for nine months after the u.s.-led invasion , piro said . `` what he wanted to really illustrate is ... how he was able to outsmart us , '' piro said . `` he told me he changed ... the way he traveled . he got rid of his normal vehicles . he got rid of the protective detail that he traveled with , really just to change his signature .

295	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- hispanics are described as the largest minority group in the united states , as a burgeoning force in the electorate and as an untapped frontier of the business market . yet these descriptions belie the complexity of the 44 million people to whom they refer . susana clar , with daughters vanessa -lrb- left -rrb- and virna -lrb- center -rrb- , says the labels `` hispanic '' and `` latino '' are limiting . even the terms used to name them -- hispanics , hispanic-americans , latinos , latino-americans , the spanish-surnamed -- too tightly package the people categorized by those definitions , some observers say . `` we are mixed and we are many things , '' said phillip rodriguez , a documentary filmmaker . many of his films , such as `` los angeles now '' and `` brown is the new green : george lopez and the american dream , '' explore the experience and identity of latinos in the united states . latinos `` very often do n't share language , do n't share class circumstances , do n't share education ; it 's very difficult to speak about them as one thing , '' he said . from a census standpoint , being of hispanic or latino origin means a person identifies himself in one of four listed categories : mexican , puerto rican , cuban or `` other spanish , hispanic or latino '' origin . in the latter more open-ended category , respondents can write in specific origins , such as salvadoran , argentinean or dominican . according to a pew hispanic center/kaiser family foundation survey in 2002 , that is how most latinos choose to identify themselves . when asked which terms they would use first to describe themselves , 54 percent said they primarily identify themselves in terms of their or their parents ' country of origin . about one quarter choose `` latino '' or `` hispanic , '' and 21 percent chose `` american . '' but the broader terms -- latino , hispanic -- are the ones tossed about when the media want to discuss a `` trend among latinos , '' or when a politician appeals to the `` hispanic vote . '' the u.s. government came up with the term `` hispanic '' in the 1970s to generally refer to people who could trace their origin to spanish-speaking countries . the term `` latino '' refers to origins from latin america , which includes non-spanish speaking countries like brazil . the terms are often used interchangeably , which is a point of some contention in the wider community . but do the terms carry meaning among the people to whom they refer , or are they merely governmental designations ? `` that 's the way you call our people , '' susana clar , 52 , said of the terms . she and her family emigrated from uruguay nearly two decades ago , and she works as a vice president in her daughter , vanessa di palma 's , salt lake city , utah-based communications firm . `` either you are latino -lsb- or -rsb- hispanic . i 'm fine with that , but i think that we are so much more than that , '' clar said . manuel baez , 49 , a native of the dominican republic who owns an insurance agency in tampa , florida , laughingly answered the question of how he identifies himself . `` manuel or manny , '' he said , adding , `` we 're being put together in this package and that 's too hard , '' he said , stressing that he did n't like labels . he continued , `` dominican-american really represents who i am , instead of dominican or latino . '' he never uses hispanic to identify himself because `` i am mixed , '' baez said . `` hispanic does n't go with me because i do n't believe that spain was the best thing for latin america . '' `` for me ... there is no such thing as a latino identity , '' said suzanne oboler , professor of puerto rican and latino studies at john jay college at the city university of new york . `` there 's certainly a cultural understanding ... -lsb- and -rsb- a political identity , '' she said , noting that the many different groups will join on particular issues such as immigration and wages . but she stressed that it was not a homogenous group . `` not all latinos speak spanish , for example . not all latinos are going to vote democratic ... all latinos are not immigrants . '' others , such as carl j. kravetz , a longtime veteran of hispanic marketing , said similarities among the different subsets of latinos do show a latino identity , one partly fused through the group 's experience in the united states . kravetz heads a los angeles-based hispanic advertising agency called cruz/kravetz : ideas . the association of hispanic advertising agencies embarked on a latino cultural identity project last year -- when kravetz was the organization 's chairman -- to better understand a group of consumers they felt could not be adequately reached through the traditional spanish-language market . there is `` very definitely a latino identity , '' kravetz said . it is drawn along parallels in values and ways of thinking and regardless of country of origin , the group tends to `` cluster '' in a few areas , he said . those areas include interpersonal relationships -lrb- latinos tend to emphasize family ; individuality is not as important -rrb- , perceptions of time and space -lrb- they have longer time horizons and have a relaxed sense of privacy -rrb- , and spirituality -lrb- religion and spirituality have a strong influence on latino life and perception of the world -rrb- . david chitel , the founder of new generation latino consortium , a group of advertising and media companies , also said there are definite cultural ties among latinos , particularly between those born in the united states . so much so , he said , that he and others coined the term `` new generation latinos '' to refer to them . `` we 're talking about people that have grown up here in the u.s. in latino households , most likely with their parents speaking spanish at home , eating certain foods at home , certain values and traditions that are instilled in them , from music to religious beliefs to the importance of family , these sorts of things , '' chitel said . `` and it creates very much an identity that is latino . '' chitel said this group of u.s.-born latinos should be reached with culturally nuanced media , in the same way the african-american market functions . still , some chafe at the labels . `` every time it comes up it just kind of annoys me and makes me mad , '' anna rivas , of boulder , colorado , said of her background . her parents emigrated from mexico before she was born , but she said she 's never identified with the mexican culture . `` on a regular basis i get asked where i 'm from , '' she said . `` and i 'll usually reply , ` my parents are from mexico . ' and i do n't say , ` i 'm hispanic or latino , or i 'm from mexico , ' because i 'm not . '' e-mail to a friend .

'' a cnn/opinion research corp. poll released friday suggested that nearly 60 percent of black registered democrats were backing obama as the presidential nominee , with 31 percent supporting clinton . that 's a major shift from october , when african-americans backed clinton over obama , 57 percent to 33 percent . what appears to have changed is obama 's electability . `` there 's been a huge shift among african-american democrats from clinton to obama . african-american democrats used to be reluctant to support obama because they did n't think a black man could be elected . then obama won iowa and nearly won new hampshire . now they believe , '' bill schneider , cnn 's senior political analyst , said . `` obama 's lead over clinton among black men is more than 50 points , and among black women , once a clinton stronghold , obama has an 11-point advantage , '' said keating holland , cnn 's polling director . entrance polls from saturday 's nevada democratic caucuses match what appears in the cnn poll . eighty-three percent of black voters questioned before they entered the caucuses said they were backing obama , with 14 percent supporting clinton , who if elected , would become the country 's first woman to win the presidency . these kinds of numbers could spell trouble in south carolina for clinton , who 's coming off victories in the new hampshire primary and the nevada caucuses . but clinton holds a special relationship with many in the black community , thanks to her efforts in support of civil rights and to the popularity of former president clinton with african-americans . both democratic front-runners were reaching out to african-american voters sunday . obama , who often refers to king in his speeches , spoke at atlanta , georgia 's ebenezer baptist church , where the late civil rights leader once preached . watch clinton , obama reach out to black voters '' obama recalled the legacy of discrimination against african-americans but challenged the audience at the historic black church to take a look at a few lingering prejudices among some within the community . `` and yet , if we are honest with ourselves , we must admit that none of our hands are entirely clean . if we 're honest with ourselves , we 'll acknowledge that our own community has not always been true to king 's vision of a beloved community , '' obama said , citing homophobia , anti-semitism and anti-immigrant sentiment . obama told the congregation sunday morning that if king could forgive his jailers , `` surely we can look past what divides us in our time . '' obama 's visit to the city coincided with his endorsement sunday by the atlanta journal-constitution , which cited his `` appeal across many of the lines that have divided america , '' adding that `` both clinton and obama would make very good presidents , -lsb- but -rsb- obama is the person ; this is his time .

302	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush on friday proposed a temporary , broad-based tax relief package aimed at spurring the nation 's slowing economy . `` we can provide a shot in the arm '' to the economy , president bush said friday at the white house . during remarks at the white house , bush , flanked by economic advisers , said the nation 's economy is at risk for a downturn and congress must act to head off trouble . `` this growth package must be big enough to make a difference in an economy as large and dynamic as ours , '' bush said . `` by passing a growth package quickly , we can provide a shot in the arm to keep a fundamentally strong economy healthy , and it will help keep economic sectors that are going through adjustments , such as the housing market , from adversely affecting other parts of our economy . '' watch more of bush 's tax outline '' it should equal about 1 percent of the nation 's gross domestic product , or roughly $ 140 billion , he added . bush said the economy will continue to grow but at a slower rate . the president offered no specific details of the proposed package , but he did insist that it include tax incentives for business , `` including small businesses , to make major investments in their enterprises this year . '' bush also said the economic package must include `` rapid income tax relief '' for consumers to `` lift our economy at a time when people otherwise might spend less . '' although democratic leaders in congress expressed general support for bush 's remarks , other democrats on capitol hill met the president 's proposal with suspicion . two democratic leadership aides made it clear friday that the growth package would not win support from democratic leaders unless it includes relief for low and middle income earners . `` we want to include people who pay taxes , not necessarily income taxes -- a lot of lower income people pay payroll taxes , '' said one aide . another source stated flatly , `` we 're not going to pass a bill in the house that does n't include low-income people . '' sen. charles schumer , d-new york , said he was disappointed that bush did not include stimulus-spending measures aimed at helping the disadvantaged such as extending unemployment benefits . schumer said such spending initiatives would jump-start the economy faster than tax cuts alone . `` i think if we avoid any of the ideological fights , we could actually pass something so that it would take effect on march 1 , '' schumer said . house speaker nancy pelosi , d-california , expressed agreement with bush on `` the need to provide assistance immediately , '' saying in a statement that `` we must invest our resources in such a way that injects confidence and consumer demand , promotes economic growth and creates jobs . '' senate majority leader harry reid , d-nevada , said , `` i also agree that our focus must be on finding temporary measures that will do the job effectively . '' sen. edward kennedy , d-massachusetts , agreed that `` we must act swiftly to boost the economy '' but stressed the need to help families who `` are struggling every day to pay their bills , heat their homes and pay their mortgages . '' bush 's remarks came a day after talks on the subject with democratic and republican lawmakers , and following federal reserve chairman ben bernanke 's call for a fiscal stimulus package to help an economy beset by plummeting stock prices and a credit and mortgage crunch . bush said friday he was encouraged by his discussions with lawmakers . `` i believe there is enough broad consensus that we can come up with a package that can be approved with bipartisan support . '' existing income tax cuts supported by the bush administration are due to expire in 2010 , and the president called on congress to make them permanent . `` unless congress acts , the american people will face massive tax increases in less than three years , '' bush said . `` this tax increase would put jobs and economic growth at risk . '' watch experts explain how to goose the economy '' the proposed stimulus package comes as a leading gauge of future economic activity was released friday by the conference board . the december report showed a decline for a third straight month for the u.s. leading index -- down two-tenths of a percent . the report cited housing permits for the largest negative contribution to the index . see chart showing americans ' recession fears '' on thursday , the dow jones industrial average of stock prices dropped more than 300 points after reports of slowing growth and massive debt write-offs by merrill lynch . the brokerage giant reported a nearly $ 10 billion loss for the fourth quarter of 2007 and wrote off more than $ 11 billion in bad mortgage debts . former treasury secretary lawrence summers stressed the importance of whom any relief package would target . `` it needs to go to people who are going to spend it , '' summers said friday on cnn 's `` american morning . '' `` that means particularly those who rely on tax refunds -- those receiving benefits , those whose incomes have been hurt by the downturn . '' bernanke told the house budget committee on thursday that he does not believe the economy will enter a recession , but he said he expects growth to proceed at a slow pace this year and possibly into early 2009 . he said congress needs to take decisive action to boost the economy . `` to be useful , a fiscal stimulus package should be implemented quickly and structured so that its effects on aggregate spending are felt as much as possible within the next 12 months or so , '' bernanke said . but he said any package should be `` explicitly temporary '' to avoid running up the government 's long-term debt . bernanke stopped short of suggesting that the bush tax cuts should be made permanent , telling lawmakers he supports `` the law of arithmetic . '' `` what comes in at least has to equal what goes out at some point , '' he said . in 2001 , americans received checks from the government designed to stimulate the economy . individuals received $ 300 and families $ 600 . twenty to 40 percent of the checks were spent within days . consumers saved one-third of the money , and two-thirds went back into the economy within two quarters , officials said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's deirdre walsh contributed to this report .
303	tampa , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- after witnessing the rapid devastation of a cayman island coral reef where he had been diving since childhood , todd barber was moved from horror to action . he gave up a six-figure salary as a marketing consultant and dedicated his life to restoring the world 's ocean reef ecosystems . `` i had been following this reef since i had been 14 ; it was where my first dive was , '' recalls barber . `` when that one little tiny reef was lost , that sparked something in me . if we lost one and it took that tens of thousands of years to get here , how fast is this happening ? '' barber had caught a small glimpse of a larger global issue -- the destruction of the world 's coral reefs -- and it scared him . according to the nature conservancy , if the present rate of destruction continues , 70 percent of the world 's coral reefs will be destroyed by the year 2050 . not only are they home to 25 percent of all marine fish species , but the organization states that 500 million people rely on coral reefs for their food and livelihoods . so barber and his father , a marine biologist and fellow diver , sat down to devise a solution to `` put the reef back . '' what started as a basic idea to shape concrete around a beach ball led to three years of research , testing and prototyping with the help of friends and college professors . watch as barber explains his passion for saving reefs '' `` our goal was to mimic nature , not dictate nature , '' says barber . `` and that meant that i could n't come up with an idea ; i had to design something that would fit exactly what the reef required . '' the result was what barber calls a `` reef ball . '' made of concrete engineered to last more than 500 years , reef balls are circular structures with a hollow center that serve as a base habitat upon which a natural reef can grow . portable , inexpensive and environmentally friendly , according to barber , reef balls can be built anywhere and are used to mimic and rehabilitate all forms of oceanic reefs , such as mangrove , oyster and coral reefs . they can also help control erosion and stabilize shorelines . watch as an organization in tampa tries to restore habitats for oysters '' to manufacture and place reef balls in marine habitats around the world , barber established the reef ball foundation in 1993 . today , the non-profit organization works with environmental agencies , universities , community groups and corporations and empowers others to build and restore their local marine ecosystems . '' -lsb- reefs -rsb- have an incredible bearing on human life , '' says barber . `` without conserving these resources , they 're going to be all gone before we even know what we 've lost . '' according to barber , marine conservation is n't just about reef balls , but they 're one important tool . `` it 's about saving natural reefs . it 's about changing our behaviors , '' says barber . `` it 's better to save the reef that you have than to build a new one . '' since its inception , the reef ball foundation has placed reef balls in more than 59 countries . `` for me , personally , the satisfaction comes from diving on a reef ball and seeing that the environment has been rehabilitated ; that the reef is actually there , '' says barber . `` and that our grandkids will be able to see the same thing .

306	kansas city , missouri -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush drew parallels between the aftermath of the vietnam war and the potential costs of pulling out of iraq in a speech wednesday . president bush draws parallels wednesday between the cost of pulling out of iraq and `` the tragedy of vietnam . '' `` three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the vietnam war and how we left , '' bush told members of the veterans of foreign wars , at their convention in kansas city , missouri . `` whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of america 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ` boat people , ' 're - education camps ' and ` killing fields , ' '' the president said . the white house billed the speech , as it did next week 's address to the american legion , as an effort to `` provide broader context '' for the debate over the upcoming iraq progress report by gen. david petraeus , the top u.s. military commander , and ryan crocker , the u.s. ambassador in baghdad . bush also sought to shore up the perception of his support for iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki , after voicing some frustration with him on tuesday . `` prime minister maliki 's a good guy -- good man with a difficult job and i support him , '' bush said . `` and it 's not up to the politicians in washington , d.c. , to say whether he will remain in his position . watch bush reiterate his support for al-maliki '' sen. edward kennedy , d-massachusetts , said bush had drawn the wrong lesson from history : . `` america lost the war in vietnam because our troops were trapped in a distant country we did not understand supporting a government that lacked sufficient legitimacy with its people , '' kennedy said in a statement . sen. joe biden , democratic chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , invoked his own vietnam analogy in a statement released after the speech : . `` it 's the president 's policies that are pushing us toward another saigon moment -- with helicopters fleeing the roof of our embassy -- which he says he wants to avoid . '' biden said bush continues to cling to the premise that iraqis will rally behind a strong central government , but he believes that will not happen . `` there 's no trust within the iraqi government ; no trust of the government by the iraqi people ; no capacity of that government to deliver security or services ; and no prospect that it will build that trust or capacity any time soon , '' biden 's statement said . but house republican leader john boehner of ohio said more democrats are `` bucking their party leaders '' in acknowledging progress in iraq . `` many rank-and-file democrats have seen this progress firsthand and are now acknowledging the successes of a strategy they 've repeatedly opposed , '' boehner said in a statement . `` but democratic leaders , deeply invested in losing the war , would rather move the goalposts and claim that a precipitous withdrawal is the right approach despite the overwhelming evidence of significant progress . '' former presidential adviser david gergen said bush ran the risk of doing as much harm as good for his case . `` by invoking vietnam he raised the question , ` if you learned so much from history , how did you ever get us involved in another quagmire ? ' '' gergen said . gergen said he did agree with bush in one respect , though : `` he 's right , initially when we pulled back in vietnam there were massive killings . '' on tuesday , bush had expressed frustration with the pace of progress toward political reconciliation in iraq , saying if the iraqi government does n't `` respond to the demands of the people , they will replace the government . '' iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki on wednesday shot back at criticism of his government , including pointed remarks from a u.s. senator who called his administration `` nonfunctioning '' and urged iraq 's parliament to turn it out of office . speaking at a press conference in the syrian capital of damascus , al-maliki characterized such comments as `` irresponsible '' and said they `` overstep the bounds of diplomatic and political courtesy . '' government spokesman ali dabbagh told cnn that al-maliki was referring to comments made monday by sen. carl levin , the michigan democrat who chairs the senate armed services committee , who called on iraq 's parliament to turn al-maliki 's `` nonfunctioning '' government out of office when it returns in two weeks . levin said al-maliki 's government was `` too beholden to religious and sectarian leaders '' to reach a political settlement that would end the country 's sectarian and insurgent violence . in his speech , bush said withdrawing from vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists by compromising u.s. credibility , citing a quote from al qaeda leader osama bin laden that the american people would rise against the iraq war the same way they rose against the war in vietnam . `` here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from vietnam carried no price to american credibility , but the terrorists see things differently , '' bush said . president bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the american people -- to withhold judgment on his troop `` surge '' in iraq until the report comes out in september . it is being closely watched on capitol hill , particularly by republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . earlier this month , defense secretary robert gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 u.s. troops in iraq might begin . bush 's speeches wednesday and next week are the latest attempts by the white house to try to reframe the debate over iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag . a recent cnn/opinion research corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the iraq war , and 72 percent say the petraeus report will have no effect on their opinion . the poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in iraq . in addition to his analogy to vietnam , bush referred to previous conflicts in asia in talking about the war against terror in iraq . `` there are many differences between the wars we fought in the far east and the war on terror we are fighting today , '' bush said . `` but one important similarity is that at their core , they are all ideological struggles . `` the militarists of japan and the communists in korea and vietnam were driven by a merciless vision for the proper ordering of humanity . they killed americans because we stood in the way of their attempt to force this ideology on others . '' bush said history proved skeptics wrong about japan 's ability to become a free society and will prove those who want to withdraw from iraq wrong . `` in the aftermath of japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the japanese transform themselves into a democracy . then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom , '' bush said . `` today , in defiance of the critics , japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies .

'' o'donnell says it takes highly trained , high energy , `` really special people '' to do such work day in and day out , especially when they 're up against `` some of the most dangerous individuals in the country . '' `` it 's not an exaggeration to say they 're the front of the front line , '' o'donnell says . `` it 's not going to get any more challenging than this in law enforcement .

'' the huckabee campaign later said the figure came from a march 2006 report by the denver post . but the border patrol told cnn on friday that it apprehended only `` a handful '' of illegal immigrants from pakistan in 2007 . the number of illegal immigrants from pakistan deported or apprehended is not mentioned in the latest report from the department of homeland security/office of immigration statistics . in 2005 , the nation did not make the list of the top 10 sources of illegal immigrants . the previous year , pakistan was the last country listed , but no specific numbers were given . huckabee is the gop front-runner in iowa , according to most polls . a los angeles times/bloomberg poll conducted december 20-23 and 26 has huckabee leading former massachusetts gov. mitt romney 36 percent to 28 percent among likely caucus goers . the poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 7 percentage points . as the campaigns enter the final stretch before the iowa caucuses on january 3 , romney has gone on the attack against huckabee , particularly focusing on his record on illegal immigration issues while he was arkansas governor . huckabee 's friday comments on immigration came after he appeared to make another gaffe thursday , when he seemed to suggest incorrectly that pakistan was under martial law . watch huckabee 's response to bhutto 's assassination '' while commenting on bhutto 's death during an orlando , florida , press conference , huckabee told reporters that the united states ' first priority should be to find the responsible parties . `` but the most urgent thing to do is to offer our sincere sympathies and concerns to the family and to the people of pakistan , and that 's the first thing we would be doing other than , again , trying to ascertain who 's behind it , and what impact does it have on whether or not there 's going to be martial law continued in pakistan , suspension of the constitution , '' huckabee said . `` those are concerns that the united states certainly should have . '' later thursday , at an event in west des moines , iowa , huckabee told cnn that `` it was not that i was unaware it was suspended , two weeks ago , lifted . ... the point was , would it be reinstated , would it be placed back in ? all of the aspects of martial law have not been completely lifted even now . there 's still a heavy hand musharraf has used . '' conservative critics immediately pointed out that pakistani president pervez musharraf lifted the country 's state of martial law roughly two weeks ago . the slip `` ought to be really bad news for huckabee , '' said the national review 's jim geraghty , writing on the magazine 's web site . `` i 'm not sure how big assassination-related news will play in the first primary states . still , i think those misstatements will exacerbate the huck/not huck divide in gop circles . '' the national review has endorsed romney . but cnn senior political analyst bill schneider said the debate over whether huckabee has command of the nuances of the pakistan crisis would have little impact on his support . `` mike huckabee is a populist . his comments on pakistan reflect a populist understanding of the crisis , which , is to say , not much , '' schneider said . `` sure , the political establishment is snickering , but i doubt that his misstatements bother his supporters much .

310	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a colorado prosecutor friday asked a judge to dismiss the first-degree murder charge against tim masters , who spent nine years in prison until new dna evidence indicated someone else might have committed the crime . tim masters , center , walks out of a fort collins , colorado , courthouse tuesday with his attorney david wymore . court papers filed by district attorney larry abrahamson cited `` newly discovered '' evidence , but took pains to state that evidence did n't clear masters . `` while the newly discovered dna evidence does not exonerate timothy masters , it clearly warrants a complete re-examination of all the evidence related to the murder of peggy hettrick , '' the court papers state . the motion seeks dismissal of the charges `` in the interest of justice . '' it points out the dna testing used to uncover the new evidence was n't available when masters was investigated and tried . on tuesday a judge threw out masters ' 1999 murder conviction , and he was freed -- also `` in the interest of justice . '' although the motion signals that abrahamson is dropping the masters case , he did not rule out future prosecution . in a statement , the prosecutor cautioned : `` contrary to news reports , the dna testing results only suggest that there may be others , along with timothy masters , who should be investigated . these test results do not provide us with enough information to completely exonerate anyone . '' abrahamson said he has asked colorado attorney general john suthers to appoint a special prosecutor to continue the investigation of hettrick 's slaying . the attorney general will announce his decision early next week , abrahamson said . masters , 36 , has been investigated for hettrick 's murder since he was 15 . he has insisted he had nothing to do with her death , and no physical evidence ties him directly to the crime . watch masters describe his anger at police '' a jury convicted masters 12 years after the discovery of hettrick 's stabbed and sexually mutilated corpse in a field near his trailer . among the evidence jurors considered were a collection of knives found in master 's bedroom , gruesome sketches and testimony from a prosecution expert that he fit the psychological profile of a killer . masters ' defense team said he was framed , and that police and prosecutors sat on evidence that could have raised doubt about his guilt . the significance of friday 's motion to dismiss is largely procedural , but abrahamson indicated earlier this week that it might be unnecessary to try masters again . `` in light of newly discovered evidence revealed to me on friday , '' abrahamson said in a statement a week ago , `` i will be moving as expeditiously as possible to make the determination of whether all charges against timothy masters will be dismissed . '' abrahamson also has vowed to review all `` contested convictions '' in which advances in dna testing may prove useful . he said he wanted to examine the legal discovery process and that he had met with the fort collins police chief and his officers `` to discuss the critical flow of information with assurance that all information is available to our office and the defense . '' special prosecutor don quick filed a motion earlier this month citing four instances in which police and prosecutors should have handed over evidence to masters ' original defense team . see the key players in the case '' among them was a police interview with a plastic surgeon who said it was improbable that a teen could have made the meticulous cuts necessary to remove hettrick 's body parts . also , according to quick 's motion , police failed to divulge that a renowned fbi profiler warned police that masters ' penchant for doodling gruesome horror scenes did not tie him to the crime . investigations into how police and prosecutors handled the case continue . e-mail to a friend .

'' cnn.com readers describe meeting ledger in person , and call him humble and kind . below are a selection of their responses , some of which have been edited for length and clarity . donal logue , actor , of los angeles , california i met heath eight years ago while working on `` the patriot . '' he became a star while we were sequestered away in a small town in south carolina based on the strength of the dailies going back to los angeles . heath was a fantastically kind and sweet young man . he surrounded himself with his friends from australia and never forgot any of us he ever worked with . i last saw him in australia when he called my name on a melbourne street and introduced me to michelle , his -lrb- then -rrb- pregnant -lsb- girlfriend -rsb- . i have great memories of going for runs with him or watching a bootleg copy of a parker and stone 's musical called `` cannibal ! the musical of the donner party tragedy . '' heath must have been in a place of great pain and sadness to be split from his wife and child . he was sensitive and unfairly victimized in his native country by the unfortunate australian custom called the `` tall poppy syndrome '' in which an australian , the second he or she achieves global success , is immediately and arbitrarily accused of losing all of their humanity . not true . he was a sweet person , and less importantly , an unbelievably talented actor . maybe the best of his generation . dan bova of larchmont , new york once when i was driving in brooklyn , i got a flat tire . as i was jacking up my car , this deep voice from behind me said , `` need a hand ? '' it was heath ledger . i could n't believe it . he helped jack up my car and change the tire . he was really good with tools ! r. of perth , western australia i grew up with heath around the speedway racing circuit . i remember the night he was a little boy and his dad was racing speed cars at claremont speedway -lrb- my dad was in the race , too -rrb- . his dad was coming 3rd then in the final corner , the two lead cars spun out and heath 's dad kim took the lead and won the state title race . heath was standing a couple of rows in front of me with his mum and sister and they were all so excited , jumping up and down and cheering . he was about as happy as a little boy could be watching his dad become a champion . i remember that night because in the years that followed , i saw his parents marriage break up and it was like there was this moment in his childhood of pure joy that i witnessed . later heath would pit crew for graham jones , and i crewed for my dad and brother . heath and i were both the youngest on our crews so that meant our job was to take the fiberglass bonnets over to the hoses and wash the mud off after each race really dirty work but he managed to stay cleaner than the rest of us . crystal davis of toronto , ontario i met heath in l.a. at a mall a year or so ago . i was staring at him working up the nerve to ask for an autograph . he saw me , started laughing and walked towards me . he said i was white as an `` egg '' and asked if he could do anything . i said , no thanks ... yes i forgot to ask for the autograph . he touched my shoulder and told me to take it easy and walked away . he looked back several times and smiled . what a great memory i have of him . my prayers go out to his family and friends . dena michnowich of glen cove , new york i was walking in the lower east side of manhattan one day and i noticed a really cute man holding his little daughter on his shoulders . she looked just like him . he told her that they had to make a right and asked her to point them in the right direction , which she did . i soon realized that it was heath ledger and i got really excited . i was walking right up to them as they were waiting to cross the street . when i got close , i waved and he smiled at me . he was so handsome i got the chills . i could also sense that he had a very sweet spirit . it was a very special moment for me . i 'm so sad to hear that he died . leanne scorzoni of staten island , new york i worked as a nanny for a number of years in manhattan , and i ended up having a toddler class with my charge and heath , michelle and baby matilda . the couple was so polite and laid back at first i did n't recognize who they were . they were genuinely interested in their child , her development , and treating the rest of us -lrb- including staff -rrb- with respect . he will be sorely missed . michael williams of perth , western australia i met heath ledger many years ago while i was working at a local fast food outlet here in perth western australia . he came through to order and i was amazed at how polite , kind and friendly he was . he stopped to sign autographs while he waited knowing that to the people asking him he was somewhat of a hero . he did all this with the great australian attitude that he had and a smile on his face , he was one superstar that took stardom well and in his stride , i for one feel thankful that i have met this great person . i send my deepest sympathy to his family and say to them that you do not mourn his passing alone ; the people of perth share your grief . tracy kimball of rock hill , south carolina i met heath ledger in 1999 while he was filming `` the patriot '' in south carolina . i was a reporter for a daily newspaper there and he was at a press conference about the movie at historic brattonsville , a revolutionary-era plantation . he was so very kind and was more than happy to sign my newspaper . the media was flocking around mel gibson , but seeing a new young and dashingly gorgeous guy standing off to himself , i approached him and asked for his autograph . he flashed that smile , grabbed my pen and used my back to sign the newspaper i was holding . we had a conversation , but i do n't remember it because i was so enamored . i had never heard of him before because the only american movie he had filmed was `` ten things i hate about you , '' which i had not yet seen . i went back to the paper where i worked and wrote a story about the new hot aussie star that would surely become hugely successful in america . his death really saddens me . he was such a talented actor and a new dad . having a child the same age as his daughter , it makes me even sadder to think of her missing her father . amanda olmstead of penticton , british columbia i met heath when he was filming `` brokeback mountain '' in my hometown of fort macleod . he was a down to earth man with amazing talent . his portrayal of ennis del mar was life-changing for many of my friends . i am truly saddened by his death . kristy o'connor of sydney , australia my heart goes out to heath 's family and little matilda , i met heath one time at a prenatal yoga class in sydney with michelle and was in awe of his devotion and attention to her . he was a true gentleman and i 'm sure an amazing father . to make assumptions as to how or why he died is to bring more pain to an already devastated family . adrian k. of perth , western australia i met heath one night on the town in perth . the one-degree of separation rule in perth made him a friend of a friend . we had a brief and quiet chat . what struck me was his calm in the face of his monstrous burgeoning celebrity . with both of his feet planted firmly on the ground , he seemed to be facing the publicity with stoic resolve . goodnight , heath . you were a good bloke . `` a sad fan '' in chicago , illinois i was an extra in the movie `` dark knight , '' which filmed in chicago this past summer . i spend an entire weekend on set with heath . he was rather quiet most of the time between takes , but seemed to be a nice , likeable guy . it was great to watch him work , as he was very committed to his craft . his death is a great loss . kelly fishburne of west palm beach , florida i met heath ledger while working in atlanta . we both were taking a cnn tour . he was silly , smiling all the time and we spoke about horses and riding lessons . he was also talking about the movie the patriot he filmed with mel gibson . he had to do lots of riding . he was down to earth and so very talkative . just a normal guy , hanging out . a real gentleman . jessi lee of central , south carolina i really enjoyed heath 's acting . his best movie was my favorite movie of 2005 , `` lords of dogtown . '' heath played the somewhat obnoxious skip engblom , but thinking of all the other actors who could have taken the roll , i do n't think anyone could have done it better . even two of the original zephyr shop boys themselves . tony alva & stacy peralta , said when heath came in & did the voice he would use in the film , it was like hearing skip from the past . e-mail to a friend .

313	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- valerie gooding is in the top five most powerful businesswomen in europe as named by the financial times . she runs global health and care organization bupa and under her leadership it has grown to over 8 million customers in over 190 countries and record revenues . cnn 's todd benjamin spoke to her in london and began by asking her why there are so few women at the top . she said it goes beyond family issues . gooding : women sometimes do n't put themselves forward for things . and one of the things i think about and talk about a lot is that women often lack confidence to go for the next job , the top job . they sometimes do n't wish to compete or they do n't think they 're good enough for the next thing . benjamin : why do you think that is ? gooding : partly a lack of role models , partly it may be conditioning from a very early age about what the role of women is in society and the family , in work . but also i think there is still -- i do n't like to call it a glass ceiling , but i think there is still an unseen barrier for women , which is that , if you ask most business people , would they like to promote more women , they would all say yes , they 'd love to : `` where are these women , i want to promote them , '' will be the answer . but often they do n't really automatically think of a woman first for a top job . benjamin : and what advice would you give to women who want to try and make it to the top ? gooding : well , first of all , to learn as much as you can and to make sure you 've got the right experience , the right qualifications , and to enjoy each job for its own interest and job satisfaction . but i think another piece of advice i would give to women is not to be afraid to put themselves forward and say what it is they want , because i think one thing that happens with women , which perhaps is a gender difference , is that women often hang back and think `` i will be noticed for my results , everybody will see how great i am because i 've delivered these exceptional outcomes '' . but actually life is n't like that , you have to tell people about your results and your achievements , and men are often better at doing that than women are . benjamin : what do you think separates good leadership from great leadership ? gooding : well , i think good leaders should be judged on their results . and i think of a good leader you should be able to say `` she transformed the business , '' `` she upped the performance , '' `` she exceeded the expectations of the stakeholders . '' i think of a great leader i would go to that old chinese saying , `` of a great leader the people will say `` we did it ourselves '' '' . benjamin : do you think that women in general as managers are more inclusive than men ? gooding : no , i do n't . in fact , i sometimes find these gender differences , when sort of represented in the business environment , are actually just not very useful . i think men and women have very different styles of leadership as individuals and i do n't think it goes down to straightforward gender divide . because i have seen women who are more autocratic and more leading from the front and more dictatorial , and i 've equally seen men who are very consultative . so , i do n't just think it divides that way . benjamin : you clearly love what you do . what is it about business that you think is such a buzz ? gooding : it 's the constant challenge , there 's always something new , there 's a new competitor , there 's a new pressure , there 's a new opportunity , there 's a new challenge , i think that 's what keeps us all going . i think it 's the thrill of the chase , basically . e-mail to a friend .

316	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the head of blackwater usa on sunday rejected a mounting series of reports suggesting the private contractor 's security guards opened fire on innocent iraqi civilians last month . blackwater ceo erik prince said sunday that guards `` definitely '' faced insurgent fire september 16 . `` there was definitely incoming small arms fire from insurgents '' in the september 16 incident in baghdad , founder and ceo erik prince told cnn 's wolf blitzer on `` late edition . '' there was no `` deliberate violence , '' committed by blackwater employees , he added . still , when asked whether it is possible someone with blackwater `` screwed up '' in the incident , prince replied , `` certainly it 's possible . '' he said he expects the fbi investigation to provide many answers . meanwhile , u.s. and iraqi officials continue discussing baghdad 's demand that blackwater be expelled from iraq within six months , the associated press reported sunday . american officials are also coming up with ways to fill the security gap if blackwater is forced to leave , ap reported . blackwater guards , protecting u.s. officials in iraq , face dangerous circumstances every day and have navigated the vast majority of those situations without any violence , prince told cnn . the guards just try to do their jobs , and are `` not trying to make any trouble , '' he said . the iraqi government accuses blackwater guards of opening fire without provocation on civilians in a crowded area in baghdad on september 16 , killing 17 and wounding 27 . survivors told fbi investigators blackwater guards shot at civilians presenting no threat . watch a blackwater witness describe his account '' the first u.s. soldiers to arrive on the scene after the incident told military investigators they found no evidence contractors were fired upon , a source familiar with a preliminary u.s. military report told cnn . the soldiers found evidence suggesting the guards fired on cars attempting to leave and found weapon casings on the scene matching only those used by u.s. military and contractors , the military source said . but prince on sunday told cnn , `` in the incident reports i 've seen , at least three of our armored vehicles were hit by small arms fire , incoming , and one of them damaged , which actually delayed their departure from the traffic circle while they tried to rig a tow . `` so there was definitely incoming small-arms fire from insurgents .

317	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the announced pregnancy of jamie lynn spears -- the 16-year-old children 's television star and younger sister of beleaguered pop star britney spears -- is casting new light on how states deal with the thorny issue of consensual sex among teens . jamie lynn spears , shown in september , stars in the popular nickelodeon series `` zoey 101 . '' spears , the star of nickelodeon 's `` zoey 101 , '' told ok! magazine that she 's pregnant and that the father is her 18-year-old boyfriend . there has been no public talk of criminal prosecution in the case . consensual sex between the two may well have been legal , depending on where and when it took place . but critics of the nation 's statutory rape laws say that laws that are ignored in some cases can be used to put other teens in prison and land them on sex-offender registries . watch cnn 's sunny hostin on what the law says '' `` you have a disturbing disparity in how these laws are enforced , '' said jonathan turley , a law professor at george washington university . `` i have no problem at all with nailing adults who sleep with children , but i have a problem with the prosecution of teenagers in consensual relationships . `` what this case should focus the nation on is having a more evenhanded approach to these cases . '' watch a psychologist talk about how spears ' pregnancy could lead to parents talking to their kids about sex '' in louisiana , where spears lives , it is a misdemeanor for someone age 17 to 19 to have consensual sex with someone age 15 to 17 if the difference between their ages is more than two years . in california , where she sometimes tapes her television show , it 's a misdemeanor to have sex with someone younger than 18 if the offender is less than three years older . someone more than three years older could be charged with a felony . according to ok! magazine , which first reported the news tuesday , spears said the father of her baby is longtime boyfriend casey aldridge . turley said most states have similar laws but rely on prosecutors to be selective in enforcing them . but that 's a recipe for legal problems , he said . the issue drew international attention when a georgia teen was sentenced to 10 years in prison for having consensual oral sex with a 15-year-old girl when he was 17 . in 2005 , genarlow wilson was tried for the rape of a 17-year-old girl at a hotel-room party . while he was found not guilty of that charge , he was convicted of aggravated child molestation for the act with the 15-year-old -- even though he was less than two years older . georgia law , which has since been changed , required a mandatory 10-year sentence on the charge of aggravated child molestation and required wilson to register as a sex offender when he was released . under the revised georgia law , the act now would be a misdemeanor . now 21 , wilson was released from prison in october -- after serving more than two years -- when the state supreme court ruled his sentence was `` grossly disproportionate to his crime . '' `` the current laws leave too much to prosecutorial discretion , '' turley said . `` we saw in the wilson case how prosecutorial discretion can lead to grotesque results . '' he said statutory rape prosecutions of teens are more common in southern states and small towns than they are elsewhere in the country or in big cities . b.j. bernstein , wilson 's attorney , argued throughout his case that wilson was imprisoned for an act that , while perhaps morally questionable , probably is going on among teens everywhere . `` if you prosecuted , even with misdemeanors , all those cases , you 'd clog up the justice system with kids having sex , '' she said . `` it 's a social issue -- and it may be something that parents do n't want to happen or wish would n't happen at that age -- but it should n't be a crime . '' spears , who turned 16 on april 4 and says she is 12 weeks into her pregnancy , told the magazine she plans to raise her child in louisiana , `` so it can have a normal family life . '' nickelodeon released a statement saying the network respects spears ' decision `` to take responsibility in this sensitive and personal situation . '' e-mail to a friend .

325	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- despite the obvious claims of younger rivals cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi , few can really argue with the 96 football journalists who voted ricardo izecson dos santos leite as the 2007 world footballer of the year . brazilian genius kaka fully deserves winning the 2007 world footballer of the year award . the prestigious ballon d'or award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and kaka 's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25-year-old brazilian 's current standing in world football . when ac milan defeated liverpool in the champions league final in athens , avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in istanbul two years previously , it enabled kaka to fulfill his dream of holding aloft europe 's premier trophy -- a winner 's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90-minute performance . kaka 's stock for both club and country has risen steadily since his move to the san siro from sao paulo for a fee of just $ 8.5 million in the summer of 2003 . unlike many a brazilian sporting genius , kaka did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town . he was born into a comfortable middle class brasilia family , where football was not the only hope of a bright future . however , it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by sao paulo , after his family had moved there , at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18-year-old . kaka 's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and felipe scolari named the graceful midfielder in his 23-man squad for the 2002 world cup finals , earning him a winners ' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against costa rica . a year later , and kaka was on his way to milan . within a month he had made the starting line-up and his 10 goals helped the rossoneri lift the scudetto and the european super cup . throughout his career , kaka has always possessed the innate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and country sees him average roughly a goal every three games . yet to describe kaka merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice . tall , elegant and blessed with astonishing skill , milan and brazil utilize kaka 's ability superbly . milan coach carlo ancelotti soon recognized kaka 's genius , changing his team 's system to a 4-4-1-1 , playing the brazilian behind a main target man . with andrea pirlo and gennaro gattuso holding the central midfield area , kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker , be it filippo inzaghi , ronaldo or alberto gilardino . and kaka does this with devastating effect , running at the opposition with pace and power , finding defense-splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead-ball situation or open play . the fly in the ointment for milan comes in the shape of their poor form this season . although they have already reached the last 16 of the champions league , the club are floundering in serie a and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season 's competition unless they win the trophy . real madrid have coveted kaka for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if milan do n't secure a place among europe 's elite . e-mail to a friend .

'' obama downplayed the significance of the accusation . `` i 've written two books , wrote most of my speeches . so i think putting aside the question ... in terms of whether my words are my own , i think that would be carrying it too far , '' obama said . `` deval and i do trade ideas all the time , and you know he 's occasionally used lines of mine , '' obama said . obama said he also used some of deval 's words at a jefferson-jackson dinner in wisconsin . `` i would add i 've noticed on occasion sen. clinton has used words of mine as well , '' said obama . `` as i said before , i really do n't think this is too big of a deal . '' obama campaign officials said clinton had a pattern of borrowing from some of her rival 's signature phrases , including `` yes , we can '' and `` fired up , ready to go . '' they circulated a youtube video and list of these alleged instances to reporters . the clinton campaign earlier pointed to similarities between the words of obama and patrick that have raised eyebrows and attracted traffic on youtube . a central passage in a speech obama gave saturday -- aimed at convincing voters that his campaign is not just about lofty rhetoric -- is adapted from one that patrick used in his 2006 campaign , the obama campaign said when asked about it . the controversy is lost on the massachusetts governor , who endorsed obama . obama 's campaign had patrick call the new york times over the weekend and issue a statement . `` senator obama and i are long-time friends and allies . we often share ideas about politics , policy and language , '' patrick said in the statement . `` the argument in question , on the value of words in the public square , is one about which he and i have spoken frequently before . given the recent attacks from senator clinton , i applaud him responding in just the way he did . '' watch a comparison of obama 's and patrick 's speeches '' the obama campaign also confirmed comments chief strategist david axelrod -- an adviser on obama 's senate campaign and patrick 's gubernatorial run -- made to the new york times about the speeches . `` they often riff off one another . they share a world view , '' axelrod told the times about obama and patrick . `` both of them are effective speakers whose words tend to get requoted and arguments tend to be embraced widely . '' responding to attacks from clinton that he offers words while she offers action , obama has been arguing that words matter . saturday night at a gala for the wisconsin democratic party , obama said to frequent applause , `` do n't tell me words do n't matter ! ' i have a dream . ' just words . ` we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal . ' just words . ` we have nothing to fear but fear itself . ' just words , just speeches ! '' in 2006 , patrick , fending off attacks from his rival kerry healey , told a crowd , `` her dismissive point , and i hear it a lot from her staff , is all i have to offer is words . just words . ` we hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal ' -- just words . just words . ` we have nothing to fear but fear itself ' -- just words . ` ask not what your country can do for you , ask what you can do for your country ' -- just words . ' i have a dream ' -- just words . '' clinton has argued that while obama provides rousing speeches , she has the stronger grasp of the issues and the knowledge of how to use the presidency to start making changes from `` day one . '' speaking last week at a general motors plant in ohio , she said , `` there 's a big difference between us -- speeches versus solutions , talk versus action . you know , some people may think words are change . but you and i know better . words are cheap . i know it takes work .

'' one can not be `` sorry '' for torturing and killing animals . as you know it 's been proven that those with the ability to do so also have a stronger chance of being abusive to humans . how can we allow someone like that to be a role model for children ?

329	colombo , sri lanka -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- humble woodcutter mohammed sultan nafeek 's teenage daughter moved to saudi arabia to work as a housemaid to support her family after they were displaced by the 2004 tsunami . now she is on death row , and all he can do is pray . razeena mohammad -lrb- left -rrb- and mohammad sultan nafeek , parents of rizana nafeek . rizana , who was 17 when she started work in saudi arabia , was convicted of killing a 4-month-old baby boy in her care just two weeks into her job . nafeek says the child died accidentally , choking on milk . his daughter was sentenced to beheading in a case rights groups say underlines the vulnerability of many of the 1.5 million sri lankans who work abroad -- nearly 400,000 of them in saudi arabia alone . `` our family was suffering hardship , and so our daughter volunteered to go and work abroad to send money home , '' nafeek told reuters by telephone from his modest home in mutur in sri lanka 's war-torn northeast . after the december 2004 tsunami forced them from their home , the family was displaced again by renewed civil war between the state and separatist tamil tiger rebels . nafeek visited saudi arabia with sri lanka 's deputy foreign minister this month in a bid to secure clemency and met with relations of the dead child 's parents but came away empty handed . under saudi law , a pardon is the gift of the family of the victim , and so far the parents of the dead child have refused to meet either the family or sri lankan officials . `` the cops told us : ` go and pray to allah . if you can get the forgiveness of the parents , your daughter will be free , ' '' he said . `` so i am praying all the time . '' `` if we had been able to meet the parents , we are sure they would have been willing to forgive our daughter after seeing our situation . '' the sri lankan government is investigating the agency that sent rizana to work abroad when she was technically still a child but remains hopeful she will be pardoned or exonerated . `` i am fairly confident , '' said deputy foreign minister hussein bhaila . `` we have spoken to tribal leaders of their particular tribe , we have spoken to area officials ... it is they who will now have to speak -lrb- to the parents -rrb- . '' `` his excellency the president -lrb- mahinda rajapaksa -rrb- has been following this case very keenly . this is an exceptional case because of her tender age , '' he added . rights groups accuse the government of failing to protect its expatriate workers -- one of the main sources of foreign-exchange revenues for the $ 23 billion economy -- with legal aid . they also decry saudi arabia 's legal system . `` this case raises many troubling questions about the treatment of children and foreigners in saudi arabia 's criminal-justice system , '' human rights watch said in a statement issued overnight . `` international law prohibits the death penalty for crimes committed before the age of 18 . '' saudi arabia executed four sri lankans convicted of armed robbery earlier this year , and did not inform sri lankan authorities beforehand . sri lanka reinstated its own death penalty in 2004 after the murder of a high court judge , but it has been dormant since 1976 . there is no indication any of the dozens of convicted murderers , rapists and drug smugglers on death row in sri lanka and effectively serving life prison terms will actually be executed . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .

'' what was it in your character that you think made him make that observation ? branson : well i suspect the fact that at age 13 i 'm writing him letters on how he could organize the catering better and how the school could save money , and if they save money they could then put it into better facilities for the students . and i managed to persuade him to give me a study to start my magazine and it was only when he actually finally came to me and said `` look , you 're either going to have to do your school work or your magazine , '' that i said `` well , goodbye . i 'm off to do the magazine , but thanks very much .

334	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. larry craig filed an appeal monday in his continued legal fight stemming from a bathroom sex sting this summer . sen. larry craig , r-idaho , initially said he would resign at the end of september but then changed his mind . the idaho republican wants the minnesota court of appeals to overturn a judge 's decision refusing to let him withdraw a guilty plea to misdemeanor charges stemming from his arrest in june . `` from the outset senator craig has maintained that he is innocent of any illegal conduct at the minneapolis airport , '' craig 's lawyer , billy martin , said in a written statement . `` like every other citizen , senator craig has the constitutional right to make every effort to clear his name .

335	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- federal agents have determined new york gov. eliot spitzer used a high-priced call-girl ring at least eight times in recent months , and agents had him under surveillance twice this year , sources familiar with the investigation said wednesday . sources say new york gov. eliot spitzer used a call-girl service eight times in recent months . spitzer announced his resignation wednesday , two days after reports of his connection to the emperors club vip became public . he has not been charged with a crime . he told reporters wednesday , `` i can not allow my private failings to disrupt the people 's work . '' the resignation will take effect monday . watch spitzer say he will resign '' the sources said the investigation began when new york 's north fork bank notified the treasury department about suspicious transfers of money from spitzer 's bank accounts . that investigation led agents to the alleged organizers of the prostitution ring , four of whom were charged in a criminal complaint last week , the sources said . a grand jury in new york is likely to hear evidence in the case soon , said kathleen mullin , an attorney who said she represents one of the ring 's employees . mullin would not identify her client , but said she was not the woman identified only as `` kristen '' linked to spitzer in court papers . she said her client and other women who worked for the emperors club have been asked to testify before the grand jury . asked if her client had any encounters with spitzer , mullin said , `` we have no information regarding the governor . '' wiretaps on suspected members of the ring , authorized in january , yielded more than 5,000 telephone calls and text messages and another 6,000-plus e-mails , according to court papers . in those intercepts , the organizers told clients how to arrange and pay for their trysts , a federal agent 's affidavit states . the affidavit identified clients by number , with spitzer designated `` client 9 , '' a source with knowledge of the investigation told cnn this week . sources familiar with the investigation said federal authorities wednesday were trying to clamp down on leaks of the investigation 's details . see a timeline of the investigation '' the affidavit states `` client 9 '' paid $ 4,300 for 2 1/2 hours with a call girl he arranged to meet at washington 's mayflower hotel , with some of that a deposit on a future session . court papers state he also paid for train tickets , cab fare , mini-bar and room service charges for kristen -- a 5-foot-5 , 105-pound brunette he arranged to meet the night of february 13 . kristen is a 22-year-old would-be singer from new jersey , the new york times reported wednesday . the newspaper said ashley youmans -- now known as ashley alexandra dupre -- was identified in court documents as kristen . dupre has not been charged with a crime . she made a brief appearance monday in u.s. magistrate court as a witness against four people charged with operating the emperor 's club , the times said . in an entry on her myspace page , dupre says she left `` a broken family '' and `` abuse '' in 2004 , eventually settling in manhattan `` to pursue my music career . '' `` i am all about my music , and my music is all about me , '' she writes on her myspace page . `` it flows from what i 've been through , what i 've seen and how i feel . '' dupre 's mother , carolyn capalbo , told the times she and her daughter were close , adding that `` she obviously got involved in something much larger than her . '' spitzer , whose squeaky-clean image as a corporate corruption-buster made him a rising democratic star , testified to the house financial services committee the next day about the effect of the mortgage meltdown . he took a state plane from buffalo , new york , to washington and back to new york , his office confirmed tuesday . sources told cnn that fbi agents had spitzer under surveillance at the mayflower that night -- and on an earlier occasion , on january 26 , when no prostitute showed up . his resignation is unlikely to affect decisions about whether he will face prosecution , the sources said . his attorneys were negotiating wednesday with the u.s. attorney 's office in new york in an effort to avoid criminal charges , a source told cnn . but in a statement issued after the governor 's resignation , u.s. attorney michael garcia said no agreement had been reached between his office and the governor `` relating to his resignation or any other matter . '' the resignation could be a factor in the u.s. presidential race . spitzer was a superdelegate , one of nearly 800 party leaders and officials who cast their votes at the democratic national convention . they are free to vote for any candidate they wish . spitzer was a political ally of new york sen. hillary clinton , who is currently in a tight race with illinois sen. barack obama to win the democratic nomination . a candidate must get 2,024 delegates to clinch the democratic nomination . with the race so close , superdelegates could play a larger role in determining the democratic presidential candidate than in past elections . according to two sources who spoke tuesday with cnn , spitzer hit the federal radar when a bank reported to the internal revenue service that a significant amount of money had been suspiciously transferred from one account to another . late last year , upon investigating the movement of money that the bank initially reported , the irs found that the accounts were connected to spitzer , the sources said . the irs contacted the fbi , which joined the case to investigate the possibility of government corruption . federal law requires a banking institution to file a suspicious activity report when the institution suspects a transaction is linked to a federal crime . more specifically , banks are required to report to the irs any transactions totaling $ 5,000 or more if the transactions `` involve potential money laundering or a violation of the bank secrecy act . '' the act requires businesses to keep documents that are useful for identifying and investigating money laundering . after receiving the irs report last year , the fbi corruption squad linked the account transfers to a prostitution ring , according to sources . the fbi criminal division joined the probe to look into the prostitution ring , while the federal corruption team continued its investigation into spitzer . legal experts not involved in the case have said spitzer could face some type of money-laundering charge , such as structuring a financial transaction to evade federal bank reporting requirements by breaking up a large transaction into smaller ones . sources tell cnn that prosecutors have considered pursuing a structuring charge , but have run into some difficulty . and richard smith , a former justice department official , said structuring charges are `` fairly difficult to prove .

336	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the presidents of sudan and chad signed a non-aggression agreement late thursday , aiming to halt cross-border hostilities between the two african nations . chad president idriss deby , right , and sudan 's president omar al-beshir , left , shake hands after signing the pact . the signing came after nearly two full days of talks in dakar , senegal , between sudan president omar al-beshir and idriss deby , the president of chad . senegalese president abdoulaye wade facilitated the talks , and united nations secretary general ban ki-moon met with officials from both nations and witnessed the signing of the agreement at about 10 p.m. `` the idea is to get the governments of sudan and chad to normalize their relations with each other and to halt any action that would allow for the cross-border movement of rebel factions or armed factions of either side that could hurt the other country , '' said united nations spokesman farhan haq . each country accuses the other of supporting armed rebel groups that cross the border to attempt to destabilize the government . the rival nations ' armies have skirmished several times . the united nations says refugees and armed groups have been regularly crossing the border between the troubled darfur region of sudan and chad . they allegedly include many of the rebels that attacked n'djamena , the capital of chad , in early february . as recently as thursday , just hours before the agreement was signed , chad issued a communique saying rebels from sudan had crossed the border . chad is still recovering from a failed attempt last month by rebels to overthrow deby 's regime . the united nations says the swelling number of darfur refugees and other displaced people living in eastern chad is causing serious strain on the region . kingsley amaning , the u.n. 's humanitarian coordinator for chad , said more than 10,000 people from darfur , in sudan , have fled into 12 official refugee camps in eastern chad . they join some 240,000 darfurians who have lived in chad since 2004 because of fighting in their homeland and an estimated 180,000 displaced chadians also living there . the number of displaced chadians is growing because of the recent fighting there , kingsley said . haq said the united nations , which has peacekeeping troops in the darfur region , will work to assure sudan and chad carry out the terms of thursday 's deal . the countries have signed several peace agreements in the past , only to see renewed violence flare up . e-mail to a friend .
337	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- queen elizabeth helped launch heathrow 's $ 8.6 billion new terminal 5 on friday as part of the british airport 's rejuvenation plan to maintain its status as one of the world 's most important transport hubs . a general view of the new terminal 5 at heathrow airport prior to its official opening on friday . the british monarch , who also opened heathrow 's first passenger terminal in 1955 , was present under strict security a day after a man carrying a backpack was arrested for running onto a runway at the airport . the first flights from the new terminal are scheduled for march 27 . its opening has come after 15 years of planning and construction by its owners baa -- and protests by local residents and environmental groups . it is part of a strategy which could lead to passenger numbers almost doubling to 122 million a year , with a sixth terminal and a third runway in the pipeline despite some vociferous opposition . spanish-owned baa , which also runs gatwick and stansted in britain , also plans to eventually demolish terminals 1 and 2 and replace them in a project called heathrow east . watch queen elizabeth meet airport staff . '' residents were once told by baa that there would be no fifth terminal , but the company is planning to forge further ahead despite the concerns of environmental groups . `` terminal 5 stands as a monument to the binge-flying culture this government has done so much to encourage , '' greenpeace transport campaigner anita goldsmith told the uk press association . `` it 's part of an obsession with expansion which can only mean more flights , more emissions and more climate change . '' richard dyer of friends of the earth added : `` if the government is serious about tackling climate change , the opening of terminal 5 must mark the end of airport expansion in britain . `` further expansion of heathrow would be environmentally irresponsible and is n't necessary for the economy of london .

339	london , england -- football will pay its tribute to the legend of manchester united 's busby babes on wednesday in moments of remembrance on the 50th anniversary of the munich air disaster . a memorial stone recalls the place of the munich air disaster in kirchtrudering near munich . eight players lost their lives on february 6 , 1958 , when flight 609 zu crashed on the third attempt to take off after re-fuelling in germany as united returned from knocking red star belgrade out of the european cup . sir matt busby 's side , back-to-back english champions and well positioned for a hat-trick attempt , were arguably on course to become the best united team . the united players killed at munich were geoff bent , aged 25 , roger byrne -lrb- 28 -rrb- , eddie colman -lrb- 21 -rrb- , mark jones -lrb- 24 -rrb- , david pegg -lrb- 22 -rrb- , tommy taylor -lrb- 26 -rrb- , liam whelan -lrb- 22 -rrb- and 21-year-old duncan edwards who died in hospital 15 days after the crash . they and the other 15 people who lost their lives will be remembered with a commemorative service at old trafford while a short ceremony , organised by supporters , will also take place at the memorial site in kirchtrudering , on the outskirts of munich . in keeping with tradition , united supporters will also gather under the memorial plaque at old trafford where the clock is fixed at the exact time of the final fateful take-off attempt . later in the day , a minute 's silence will take place ahead of england 's friendly with switzerland at wembley as a further mark of respect . as he bows his head during this week 's munich commemorations , survivor harry gregg 's mind will understandably flash back to that snow-laden runway , but only briefly . the 75-year-old ulsterman prefers not to remember the afternoon he lost so many friends among the victims , but instead the days when the dream of the ` busby babes ' was still vibrant and alive . goalkeeper gregg , hailed a hero in the wake of the crash after returning to the wreckage to pull out survivors , is adamant those are the times which always burn brightest in his memory . `` i was part of something that was a very , very beautiful thing at that time , '' said gregg , who cost united a record 23,000 pounds sterling when he joined from doncaster rovers two months before the disaster . `` i 'll always be proud of that . the fact there 's going to be a minute 's silence after 50 years is a tribute to the people i played with , but one must remember as well there were other people on board that aircraft , a lot more people . `` i want the minute 's silence to be over and then i want to remember the happy times , that 's what i want the world to remember , that 's what i want the families to remember .

340	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the amazon rainforest is so vast and full of life that even its defenders do n't know exactly what it is they are protecting . in the past 40 years , roughly 20 percent of the amazon rainforest has been wiped out . `` the wealth of biodiversity is so immense , we can not even estimate the amount we do n't know , '' says cláudio c. maretti , brazil-based director for conservation for the world wildlife fund . `` every new expedition you do to the amazon , you might find one new species of fish . every other , you might find some new bird or frog . '' the amazon rainforest , which encompasses an area nearly as large as the continental united states and stretches across nine countries , is considered the world 's richest and most varied natural habitat , with several million species of insects , plants , birds and fish calling it home . it also plays an important role in regulating earth 's temperature as its dense vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide and releases oxygen into the air . but the amazon has been under pressure from outside forces for decades . in the past 40 years , roughly 20 percent of the rainforest has been wiped out . maretti says an additional 17 percent has been degraded to varying degrees . `` we have been deforesting at enormous rates , '' maretti says . the chief drivers of this deforestation are large-scale business interests involved in logging , mining , agriculture and , especially , cattle ranching . some of this activity is sanctioned by the government ; much of it is not . greenpeace estimates as much as 80 percent of the logging is illegal . the amazon rainforest is just one of many habitats around the world threatened by encroaching development or natural resource extraction . the food and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- of the united nations estimates that 50,000 square miles of forest -- more than three times the size of switzerland -- are lost each year because of clearing and degradation . the threat is particularly acute in the more tropical areas of south america , africa and southeast asia . cambodia , for example , lost nearly 30 percent of its primary forests from 2000 to 2005 , according to fao . vietnam lost close to 55 percent of its primary forests , fao found . and nigeria lost nearly 56 percent of its primary forests over the same period , the worst rate of forest loss in the world , according to fao . the destruction of the earth 's oldest and richest forests is not a new phenomenon , but the rate of destruction has increased in recent decades . `` worldwide , one-half of all forests we 've lost in the last 10,000 years has occurred in the last 80 years . half of that was destroyed in the last 30 years , '' says scott paul , forest campaign coordinator for greenpeace . paul says the chief driver of forest destruction is the buying and selling of forest products and farm products in the international market , not to meet local needs . `` the timber market , and also for agriculture , mining : when it plugs into the international economic system , that 's when you 've got to watch it , '' he says . paul would like to see a certification system so that consumers know the source and conditions under which the product they 're consuming was harvested . `` if you buy wine and cheese , we can tell the region and the year . but forest products have always been cut in remote and distant areas and thrown in a pipe and spit out on the other side . there is no way to determine if something came from a well-managed forest or an illegal forest where there is slavery , murder , drug trade , etc. , '' he says . while the story of the world 's old-growth forests would appear to be one of unremitting destruction , forests lost to logging and agriculture are actually growing back in some areas , such as the northeast region of the united states and parts of europe . this thrills some wildlife advocates who would like to see the restoration of exiled or decimated species . `` northern new england is the only place in the eastern united states where you have the potential for large-scale wilderness where wolves , lynxes , cougars , woodland caribou and salmon rivers could be restored , '' according to michael j. kellett , executive director of restore : the north woods . `` we could literally have almost the entire ecosystem of the maine woods as it once was . '' with large-scale agriculture all but gone from new england and logging companies concentrating their attention elsewhere , kellett 's biggest fear is that real estate development could begin to carve up the vast forests of maine . his proposed solution : create a national park . in brazil in recent years , the government reportedly has stepped up efforts to slow the amazon 's destruction . last october , brazil said the rate of deforestation plunged 41 percent because of the enforcement of environmental laws . environmental groups say the drop also was caused by the fall of soy prices and the rise of brazil 's currency against the dollar , making the country 's exports more expensive . the world wildlife fund 's maretti is hopeful that brazil , with international help , will be able to protect even more of the amazon , an area he considers among the most vital natural habitats in the world . `` we do have strong civil society . we do have more governance , '' maretti says . `` but we certainly need support from abroad . i do n't believe brazil can do this job alone .

341	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- not only is sheikha lubna al qasimi the first woman to hold a ministerial post in the united arab emirates , the first female minister of economy in the gulf , and the first to start a middle eastern bb marketplace , but she 's also the first minister - anywhere in the world - to launch her own perfume line . member of sharjah royal family and one of forbes ' 100 most powerful women , sheikha lubna took the post of minister for economy and planning of united arab emirates in 2004 . her background is in it and before the government appointment worked at the dubai ports authority where she gained the `` distinguished government employee award '' in 1999 for developing a documentation system that reduced cargo turnaround from one hour to ten minutes . in 2000 , sheikha lubna founded tejari , the first middle eastern business-to-business marketplace . as a result of tejari -lrb- arabic for commerce -rrb- 70 percent of dubai 's government purchases are made online , while only 30 percent of bureaucrats were web-literate before its launch . one of the cornerstones of sheikha lubna 's work has been to allow for foreign ownership , so when john defterios met up with her , he began by asking her about her upcoming strategy . sheikha lubna : we are looking with scrutiny at the companies a lot at the moment and we have several sectors . we will evaluate each sector , from the service side , finance , accounting . and any sector that we believe we need further development in terms of economic growth , then we will focus on that : on increasing the acquisition or the ownership of the foreign company . defterios : if you look at the middle east , specifically within this gulf region , it 's quite a radical change to open up specific sectors to majority foreign ownership . is this society in the region ready for this move ? sheikha lubna : interestingly , the united arab emirates is host to 80 percent of its population coming from outside . we host 200 nationalities , so for us , the contribution to the economy has already started over 15 years ago with the existence of the expatriate community . so in many ways i think the openness is only a natural path : it 's an organic path to continue the openness that exists . foreign direct investment is not your own wealth . when you have your own wealth , you have a tendency to be complacent sometimes , because it 's your money and you may not think you need to actually strengthen your infrastructure . however , if you look at foreign direct investment , it mandates you to be much more transparent , you have to be very diligent about your work , and it also creates new knowledge coming into the country and you can create more development through employment . defterios : it 's interesting , you read the front line of the dp world , p&o acquisition and the furor it created in the united states particularly within congress . what are the lessons , not just from the uae perspective , but the lessons learned from both sides during that whole process ? sheikha lubna : first of all , i think it is important to understand , in this global world , there is a circulation of funds and there is excess of wealth that has to go somewhere . liquidity of markets sometimes means you invest internally or you invest abroad . we 've learned a lesson being in the oil crises earlier that you need to diversify your money and look into investment abroad . and we 've seen this where the uae invests in the far east , australia , asia as well as in europe and the united states . what 's more important to understand is that if you 're going to lock up your interest in terms of selling either because of protectionism or a particular idea in your mind that i do n't want to sell to this particular organization versus another , there are other places . defterios : that 's not a veiled message your saying , that 's pretty forthright this comment . sheikha lubna : but it 's a message to all of us . if today i lock up my investment opportunity here , money will not come to me , money will go somewhere else . when i have investment coming from abroad , it creates confidence in this country that ' i am a global image ' . so when i say it , i am not directing this as a message to a particular country . i am saying all countries are equal when it comes to regulation , when it comes to responsibility , when it comes to strategy in terms of attracting foreign funds and wealth coming to the country . so that 's really a lesson that 's very very critical . defterios : a number of firsts : the first to start a b2b marketplace ; the first female minister within the country , an economy minister ; and the first to launch a perfume range as well . what is it all about ? trailblazing , setting examples , being an entrepreneur ? how would you describe what you 're doing here ? sheikha lubna : everybody laughs about the perfume . one , i think the united arab emirates , since inception -lrb- it 's not from today but from the founder late sheikh zayed -rrb- has always given equal opportunities for women . but it 's up to us as women to decide what is it that we can push , and what it is that we can do and not do . in my personal belief you need a bridge , you need a door opener for women . and sometimes women do not want to take the risk . sometimes they are shy of achieving what they should be achieving . i had the opportunity and i had the trust from the government and the community , so to me , it is setting the example internally for the young women , and men by the way . be it in technology , or economy or e-commerce . defterios : and the perfume line is the exclamation point ? sheikha lubna : a young woman , actually a perfume creator , who sells exclusively to saks fifth avenue in dubai , decided to create a perfume with my name . so i had two mandates from her . one , i had to smell it , otherwise if it does n't smell good i 'm not going to take it as a name . so one , i had to actually agree to the scent of the perfume . and it 's an arabic perfume by the way . and second , my mandate was that i would only launch it with my name for her , if she gives 20 percent of its sales and revenue to the friends of cancer patients . e-mail to a friend .

'' wissman is uniquely positioned to `` get everybody involved . '' more than a priest or even a bishop in this arts-mission field , he 's a cardinal in the industry , the chairman of img artists , a major player in world artists ' representation . img 's roster includes violinists joshua bell and itzhak perlman , mezzo-soprano fredericka von stade , flutist james galway , guitarist christopher parkening , the joffrey ballet and composer jay greenberg , among many others . wissman has just announced a new managing director for img in north and south america , elizabeth sobol . she is , herself , a co-producer of a new festival in boca raton , florida , and architect of a highly publicized new joint venture for img with gorfaine-schwartz , the agency representing trumpeter-composer chris botti , cellist yo-yo ma , singer-songwriter james taylor and hollywood film composer john williams . no matter how far-flung the festivals and events , wissman stays near his roots . `` i 'm a pianist , '' he says , `` a concert pianist . i still play , i play from time to time in the festivals . so i 'm a musician , i come from the arts . '' in the case of napa 's festival del sole , wissman has a co-founder , san francisco-based attorney richard walker , who has a specialization in artists ' management . watch an audio slide show in which richard walker talks about the atmosphere of the festival '' having worked with mikhail pletnev 's russian national orchestra , walker says , since its inception in 1990 as the first symphonic entity founded after the soviet union 's collapse , he emphasizes the stylistic range demanded in festival work . and walker echoes wissman 's interest in making these festivals oases in the itinerant lives of world-traveling artists . `` the events that surround the musical performances , '' walker says , `` are attended by the artists , themselves -- a time of camaraderie for them because they see each other and spend time enjoying each other 's company . '' as if on cue , two world-class pianists , polish-hungarian piotr anderszewski and french-born jean-yves thibaudet , are seated at the same table at a gala post-concert dinner held by far niente wine estate on a cloudless night in a circular arbor crowded with honeysuckle . thibaudet jumps up at one point to accompany violinist bell in manuel ponce 's `` estrellita , '' watched by composer marco tutino and cellist nina kotova . read about joshua bell 's recent win of the $ 75,000 fisher prize . `` we are located in a wonderful hotel , '' says conductor denève , the newlywed whose base of operations is glasgow where he is music director of the royal scottish national orchestra . `` wonderful swimming pool , actually it 's a great way to socialize and get to know more and more the fellow artists because usually you are engaged and just have one or two nights . '' thibaudet places a similar premium on these festivals ' sense of community for artists . `` when we have concerts , '' he says , `` we just come into town , we play and we leave . usually there wo n't be any other soloists , there 's only you . so we never get to meet each other during the year . '' and it appears that the napa community could n't be happier than to find these major concert and recording artists `` working the valley . '' in a kind of vine-roots , if not grassroots , effort , the wineries have jumped with endearing eagerness into what walker terms a `` friendly competition '' for whose after-concert gala can be the most opulent . they lay on rich dinners set at starlit tables , some by glowing pools , others on cricket-chirpy hilltops and still others under chandeliers hung high in some of the most honored wine-making facilities in the country . one of the venues for the festival this year has been the medieval-looking castello di amorosa , another the renovated lincoln theatre in yountville . wineries participating in special events around an intensely proud sponsorship of the festival have included far niente , the copelands ' bouchaine vineyards , darioush winery , clos pegase , robert mondavi winery , peju province winery , pine ridge winery and st. supéry vineyards and winery . many of these are festival-funding partners , joined by domaine chandon , blackbird vineyards , dalla valle vineyards , plumpjack winery , folio winemakers ' studio , gargiulo vineyards , swanson vineyards and copia , a nonprofit center of wine-making culture in the valley . the vintners , themselves , seem to enjoy the chance to mingle in the common interest of the festival and in the company of these artists they seem to be tying onto their hearts like vine tendrils in their fields . margrit mondavi is a welcome guest one evening at far niente , as are tatiana and gerret copeland of the bouchaine house . florence 's maria manetti farrow , whose ranging villa mille rose is an influential olive oil estate , seems to be everyone 's fondest table mate and every artist 's favorite dinner companion . resort partners include auberge du soleil , calistoga ranch , solage calistoga , the carneros inn and silverado resort . walker , in fact , estimates that the napa festival -- which with cortona and singapore is produced by the nonprofit del sole foundation for the arts and humanities -- could cost as much as $ 10 million to stage , if the many in-kind services provided by hoteliers , wineries and others were totaled in cash . the `` rehearsals '' for all this , if you will , took place in cortona , where wissman and charles letourneau , executive producer , have staged several years of festival events in what wissman likes to call `` a magical , fellini-esque feel . '' when he looked for a spot in the united states to base a sister festival , `` napa was the perfect place , '' close to the metropolitan pace of san francisco but removed enough to shelter artists and audiences in peace . wissman looks across a long , candlelit table amid shadowy great barrels of bouchaine wine . french conductor denève has tatiana copeland 's dinner guests in stitches with his tale of how he proposed to his new wife on the glass floor high atop the canada 's national tower in toronto -- `` my god , it was frightening !

343	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the united states imposed stiff sanctions against iran on thursday , targeting two iranian military groups and a number of iranian banks and people it accuses of backing nuclear proliferation and terror-related activities . `` what this means is that no u.s. citizen or private organization will be allowed to engage in financial transactions with these persons and entities , '' secretary of state condoleezza rice said . `` in addition , any assets that these designees have under u.s. jurisdiction will be immediately frozen . '' rice and treasury secretary henry paulson made the announcement in a brief appearance before reporters on thursday morning . rice accused iran of `` pursuing nuclear technologies that can lead to a nuclear weapon ; building dangerous ballistic missiles ; supporting shia militants in iraq and terrorists in iraq , afghanistan , lebanon and the palestinian territories ; and denying the existence of a fellow member of the united nations , threatening to wipe israel off the map . '' watch rice tell why sanctions are being imposed '' `` many of the iranian regime 's most destabilizing policies are carried out by two of its agencies : the islamic revolutionary guard corps , or the irgc , and the quds force , an arm of the irgc , '' she said . she said the sanctions were being imposed `` because of the revolutionary guard 's support for proliferation and the quds force support for terrorism . '' the united states also designated three iranian state-owned banks for sanctions , two of them `` for their involvement in proliferation activities '' and the other `` as a terrorist financier , '' rice said . `` iran funnels hundreds of millions of dollars each year through the international financial system to terrorists , '' paulson said . `` iran 's banks aid this conduct using a range of deceptive financial practices intended to evade even the most stringent risk management controls .

'' gambari said he will return this week to new york to brief u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon on the five-day trip to myanmar , also called burma . the situation in the secretive asian nation is not what it was `` a few weeks ago , '' said a u.n. statement released in conjunction with the end of gambari 's trip . `` we now have a process going which would lead to substantive dialogue between the government and daw aung san suu kyi , '' the statement said . `` the sooner such a dialogue can start , the better for myanmar .

'' how many times has that phrase been used ? it 's such a common phrase it 's as if what really happened gets glossed over : skin scraped off their bodies , fingernails ripped out , horrifying screams of pain before death . how many times have we reported death tolls from one horrific bombing or another and not been able to get across that these are lives that literally were blown apart ? no matter how hard we in the media try , iraq remains a nation filled with untold tragedies , the scope of which so often is overwhelming . and no matter how hard iraqis try to shield themselves and those they love from the horrors here , more often than not they fail . yet they keep fighting . see the sacrifices of iraq 's women '' nahla works at a radio station and is one of those women . she 's tall , slender , elegantly dressed and has a firm handshake . i look at her and it 's nearly impossible to imagine what she 's been through . `` this numbers game , you always think that you are exempt from the numbers , '' nahla tells me , referring to the daily death toll . `` you 're pained by them , but you are outside of them .

'' the police and security force is expected to be deployed to the balkan state ahead of an announcement of independence . `` this is the clearest signal that the eu could possibly give that it intends to lead on the whole issue of kosovo 's future , its status and its role in the region , '' socrates said . according to cnn 's robin oakley in brussels , european leaders are trying to balance an obvious readiness to back kosovan independence with incentives to serbia , which is seeking membership of the eu . eu leaders are deeply conscious of their failure in the early 1990s to move early enough to prevent the bloodletting in the balkans over the break-up of the former yugoslavia , he said . although most eu leaders support serbia becoming a member state to boost stability in the balkans , french president nicholas sarkozy said that serbia 's membership is dependent on it recognizing kosovo 's independence and handing over war criminals . socrates confirmed to cnn that any fast-tracking of serbia into the eu could only be considered if it agreed to hand over ratko mladic , the bosnian serb general wanted at the the hague for suspected war crimes . two years of negotiations on the future status of kosovo ended in failure earlier this week , when talks mediated by europe , the united states and russia ended without an agreement . the disputed province is dear to the serbs , orthodox christians who regard it as serbian territory . but it is equally coveted by kosovo 's ethnic albanians , muslims who have a 90 percent majority . since 1999 the united nations has been running the province with nato peacekeepers , who still number 16,000 . oakley said the eu mission to kosovo would help to ease the handover from the u.n. to local authorities . e-mail to a friend .

355	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- investigators with bomb-making components in their luggage and on their person were able to pass through security checkpoints at 19 u.s. airports without detection , according to the government accountability office . passengers pass through security at o'hare international airport in chicago , illinois . gao officials are expected to testify about the investigation thursday before the house committee on oversight and government reform . the investigators reported that most of the time security officers followed transportation security administration policies and procedures , but investigators were able to take advantage of `` weaknesses in tsa procedures and other vulnerabilities . '' `` these weaknesses were identified based on a review of public information , '' the planned gao testimony says . investigators concluded that if they had attempted the same test at other airports , they would have evaded detection . but the gao did not detail the weaknesses because they `` are sensitive security information . '' the investigators obtained the bomb-making components at local stores and over the internet for less than $ 150 , according to testimony . watch a tester point out a tsa mistake '' the gao said its investigators also tested the devices that could be built with the components they smuggled and discovered that `` a terrorist using these devices could cause severe damage to an airplane and threaten the safety of passengers . '' the gao investigators devised two types of devices : an `` improvised explosive device '' made of a liquid explosive and a low-yield detonator , and an `` improvised incendiary device '' that could be created by combining commonly available products prohibited in carry-on luggage . the gao said it found the instructions for creating the devices `` using publicly available information , '' including internet searches . according to the testimony , a transportation security officer barred one of the investigators from bringing an unlabeled bottle of medicated shampoo through the checkpoint . but the security officer allowed a liquid component of the improvised explosive device to pass through undetected , although that item is prohibited by the tsa . in another test , the investigator put coins in his pockets to assure he would get a secondary inspection . but the officer , using a hand-wand and a pat-down , failed to detect any of the prohibited items the investigator was carrying . the gao said it had briefed the tsa on its findings `` to help them take corrective action . '' in testimony to be provided to the same congressional committee , tsa chief kip hawley defends the administration 's policies and procedures , saying that the screening checkpoints are but one of a `` multilayered approach to security . '' `` we recognize that , despite our efforts to make each layer as strong as possible , a concerted effort may target any one layer , '' according to the testimony . `` our ongoing success is a result of the tremendous power in the reinforced , multiple layers . truly , the whole is greater than the sum of the parts -- and together , they are formidable . '' hawley sketches for members of congress 19 security steps the tsa employs before , during and after checkpoint screening . `` each and every one of these 19 security layers is important and strong in its own right , '' he says . `` linked together , they are effective and daunting . '' although it would not discuss the specific nature of its recommendations , the gao said it recommended establishing special screening lines based on risk and passengers with special needs . the tsa should introduce more `` aggressive , visible and unpredictable '' measures to detect concealed items and develop new technology for screening at checkpoints . hawley 's said the tsa concurs with the gao 's recommendations and specifically discussed several `` new technology '' items that he said were `` greatly improving our effectiveness in detecting prohibited items . '' among the new technology , he said , were whole body imagers , bottled liquids scanners , hand-held explosives scanners and advanced technology x-rays . and , he added , `` our pursuit of new technology is not limited to what i described today . '' he also said the tsa is constantly conducting covert tests of the screening process , including detection of prohibited liquids and ieds . `` the nation 's aviation system remains secure , '' he said , `` but requires ongoing improvement and vigilance to stay ahead of the threat of terrorism .

358	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- as the war in iraq reaches its five-year anniversary this week , two of the world 's leading humanitarian groups issued extensive reports monday describing a crisis of huge proportions with little reason for hope . iraqi women mourn the death of their relative outside the morgue in the restive city of baquba , iraq , on march 12 . `` despite claims that the security situation has improved in recent months , the human rights situation is disastrous , '' amnesty international says in its report , titled `` carnage and despair : iraq five years on . '' in a summary of the report , amnesty writes that `` a climate of impunity has prevailed , the economy is in tatters and the refugee crisis '' keeps escalating . the international committee of the red cross , in a report titled `` iraq : no let-up in the humanitarian crisis , '' writes , `` despite limited improvements in security in some areas , armed violence is still having a disastrous impact . civilians continue to be killed in the hostilities . `` the injured often do not receive adequate medical care . millions of people have been forced to rely on insufficient supplies of poor-quality water as water and sewage systems suffer from a lack of maintenance and a shortage of engineers . '' the bush administration and many republican lawmakers , including presidential candidate sen. john mccain , have frequently praised successes in iraq in recent months , noting improvements in security in key areas . they attribute that in part to the buildup of u.s. troops in iraq ordered by president bush last year . vice president dick cheney described the five year u.s.-led invasion of iraq in a news conference monday during a visit to baghdad . `` this week marks the fifth anniversary , '' said cheney . `` it has been a difficult , challenging , but none the less successful endeavor . '' democrats , including presidential hopefuls hillary clinton and barack obama , have said the government failed to use the downturn in violence to achieve the steps it was supposed to make possible . sen. john mccain met with iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki on monday where he stressed the united states ' commitment to iraq . `` we recognize that al qaeda is on the run , but they are not defeated . al qaeda continues to pose a great threat to the security and very existence of iraq as a democracy . so we know there 's still a lot more work that needs to be done , '' he said . amnesty writes , `` key political benchmarks have yet to be realized . '' both amnesty and the red cross slam the iraqi government for failing to grapple with the critical needs of their populations . amnesty also says the iraqi government and the u.s.-led multi-national forces are responsible for some nightmarish circumstances . `` civilians are also at risk from multi-national forces and iraqi security forces , with many killed by excessive force and tens of thousands detained without charge or trial , '' amnesty writes in its summary . `` the death penalty was reintroduced in 2004 and hundreds of people have been sentenced to death . at least 33 people were executed in 2007 , many after unfair trials . '' in its report , amnesty says the iraqi government `` has failed to introduce practical measures to deal with the gross and serious human rights violations perpetrated by its security forces . there appears to be no serious willingness to investigate properly the many incidents of abuses , including killings of civilians , torture and rape , and to bring those responsible to justice . `` the government has also been unable to reign in shiite militia groups , such as the mehdi army , or to rid the interior ministry of death squads . the fact that the government is divided along sectarian lines has serious repercussions on its effectiveness and bodes ill for the future . '' the two reports cite a litany of concerns , including severe widespread poverty , a lack of food and water , and broken families left to scrounge for whatever they can find to get by . both reports describe a situation that shows no sign of clear improvement . amnesty also says conditions for women have worsened with the rise of fundamentalist religious groups . many women `` have been forced to wear islamic dress or targeted for abduction , rape or killing . '' the group notes a study by the world health organization in 2006/2007 that found 21 percent of iraqi women had experienced physical violence . amnesty adds that the `` predominantly kurdish region of northern iraq has been more stable with fewer acts of violence , and has seen growing economic prosperity and foreign investment . however , here too there continue to be serious human rights violations , including arrests for peaceful political dissent , torture , ill-treatment , the death penalty and the killing of women in so-called honor crimes .

360	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- solid support from registered democrats and women in new hampshire were crucial tuesday as sen. hillary clinton rebounded from her third-place finish in last week 's iowa caucuses . sen. hillary clinton has spent the past few days saying she has the experience to change washington . she narrowly defeated sen. barack obama in the new hampshire primary , with 39 percent of the vote to obama 's 37 . `` last week , i listened to you , and in the process i found my own voice , '' the new york senator said after her victory . `` now let 's give america the kind of comeback that new hampshire has just given me . '' forty-three percent of self-styled independents said they voted for obama , and 31 percent said they backed clinton . independents made up 43 percent of all voters polled . addressing his roaring supporters after the race was called , obama congratulated clinton . but he was a candidate determined to draw a distinction between clinton and himself . `` but the reason our campaign has always been different , the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago , is because it 's not just about what i will do as president , '' he said . `` it is also about what you , the people who love this country , the citizens of the united states of america , can do to change it . that 's what this election is all about . '' but clinton was ahead of obama 45 percent to 34 percent among those who said they were registered democrats . those voters made up a majority -- 54 percent -- of all respondents . clinton also claimed the majority of women 's votes , according to the polling . that 's in contrast to last week 's iowa caucuses , in which obama surprised observers by stealing the female vote from clinton . analysts say that shift among female voters was crucial to the clinton turnaround . `` if i had a single word , the word would be ` women , ' '' said cnn political analyst bill schneider . `` she got the women back . '' and schneider said the support of union voters that put clinton over the top . `` union voters have her a 10 point lead , '' he said . cnn projected former sen. john edwards to finish third . college graduates , who made up 29 percent of the electorate , opted narrowly for clinton -- 38 percent to obama 's 37 percent , according to the polling . those polled who called themselves very liberal , and moderate , went with clinton over obama -- although by less than 2 percentage points in each -- and those who said they are somewhat liberal were evenly split . pundits also were citing the role of former president bill clinton in helping his wife recover from what pre-primary polls were suggesting was a deficit of 9 percentage points to obama in new hampshire . the former president spent tuesday in hanover -- home to dartmouth college -- where obama had been expected to win handily . `` they dispatched him to the area that obama was surging , '' said cnn analyst donna brazille , who managed former vice president al gore 's campaign in 2000 . `` i think it had the effect of tamping down obama support and giving senator clinton a real reason to come back in this race . '' new hampshire was considered crucial to clinton 's campaign . if obama had been able to sweep iowa and new hampshire -- after months of clinton being considered the front-runner among democrats -- it could have given him powerful momentum going into future primaries . `` age is also playing a big factor -- older voters are overwhelmingly outnumbering younger voters -- a proportion that is clearly benefiting clinton , '' schneider said . `` sixty-seven percent of democratic primary voters are over the age of 40 , and they are breaking heavily for clinton over obama . '' over the past several days , clinton has trumpeted her experience , saying that she has delivered change as both first lady and as a senator . after losing to obama in last week 's iowa caucuses , it was unclear whether she could overcome what appeared to be obama 's ability to electrify american voters who had previously taken a sour and skeptical view of politicians and the political process . the duel between the obama and clinton campaigns grew especially testy monday and tuesday . she said she had more experience than he , and was therefore more qualified . he accused her of representing the status quo of washington . and on the eve of the new hampshire primary , bill clinton criticized the media for not pressing obama more fully on iraq , and accused the illinois senator of shifting his position to reflect changing attitudes about the war in iraq . then , there was an issue unto itself -- hillary clinton 's almost-tears . clinton 's eyes welled up this week while responding to a voter 's question about her health and appearance . pundits and voters alike questioned whether clinton 's emotions were sincere or faked as part of some strategy to diminish criticism that she is too steely , too cold . in front of the crowd of mostly female new hampshire voters , an admittedly fatigued clinton responded to a question by saying : `` this is very personal for me , it 's not just political , it 's -lsb- that -rsb- i see what 's happening , we have to reverse it . '' her voice broke , and she was then applauded by the crowd . polls indicated the show of emotions fared well with male voters , according to cnn 's john king , but turned off some female voters . edwards was followed in votes by new mexico gov. bill richardson and ohio rep. dennis kucinich . e-mail to a friend .

'' art thieves do a simple risk versus reward evaluation , said corine wegener , associate curator of the minneapolis institute of arts . thieves know that `` even if they receive only a fraction of the work 's market value , the cash gained was at low risk of death or injury -- museums can be a relatively soft target , '' said wegener , who 's teaching a university of minnesota class this month on art theft . but it could be years -- or never -- before the thief sees even a small payoff . in 1990 , robbers took $ 300 million worth of certified masterpieces -- among them rembrandt 's `` storm on the sea of galilee '' and vermeer 's `` the concert '' -- from the isabella stewart gardner museum in boston , massachusetts . no one 's seen them since . on sunday , robbers made off with one of the biggest art hauls in european history , grabbing four paintings worth an estimated $ 163 million from the e.g. buehrle collection in zurich , switzerland . they took works by paul cezanne , edgar degas , claude monet and vincent van gogh . see what robbers grabbed in switzerland '' `` these paintings are extremely valuable on the open market , but they 'll never go onto the open market . so at the same time they 're both priceless and worthless , '' said charles hill , the former chief of scotland yard 's art and antiques unit . `` some thieves may buy into the myth that a wealthy but unscrupulous collector will contact them and offer to take the art off their hands , '' wegener said . `` when this does n't happen , the thieves often try to ransom the art back to the museum or the insurance company . '' one london art dealer , who said he has handled stolen works , told cnn on condition of anonymity that an insurance company would rather get art back at a fraction of its original price than pay the owner its insured value . watch how art thieves operate '' ransoming art to an insurance company through an intermediary adds `` up to 10 percent of the market value , which ... given the art market , is quite a lot of money , '' the dealer said . david vuillaume , secretary general of the swiss museums association , told time magazine that ransom may be what the thieves behind the swiss heist want . `` we are thinking that maybe in a week or two there will be a ransom demand . but we just have to wait and see , '' time quoted him as saying . the museum has offered $ 90,000 reward for information leading to their recovery , time reported . options for art thieves . julian radcliffe , chairman of the art loss register , which operates a database to help recover lost and stolen art , said ransom or reward are unlikely to bring results . `` it is very seldom that people have been able to undertake a ransom , '' he said . `` this gang might think that a reward has been offered , and that they 'll get the reward . '' but in fact , `` the reward wo n't be paid unless someone is arrested , or there is proper criminal intelligence , '' and that 's unlikely to happen , radcliffe said . he said the thieves may just be patient , willing to get their payoff decades later . or the art may move through an underground network , gradually increasing in value , before being slipped back onto the legitimate market . take spielberg . he bought `` schoolroom '' in an above-the-board transaction . `` usually , these pictures will change hands in the criminal underworld at a fraction -- 1 percent or less -- of their true market value , '' radcliffe said , before someone tries to get them back into the international market . in such an effort , the seller may hope the work has been forgotten over time or they may disguise it as a copy or student re-creation . `` they may try and sell them not as being by degas , but as being a copy , or school , or by a follower of one of the great artists . and that is the ways in which they try and get them on the market , '' radcliffe said . the original thieves rarely face justice , the fbi 's magness-gardiner said . `` the stolen items turn up years , sometimes decades , after the theft , '' she said . `` because a work of art does not require a title document in order to be transferred from one owner to another , a stolen object easily enters the legitimate stream of commerce . `` it is impossible to trace them back to the original thief in most cases . even if the original thief can be identified , there is also a statute of limitations on prosecution for theft , '' magness-gardiner said . what happens to stolen art ? even if the art is recovered , original owners may not get it back . while museum pieces are likely to go back to their collections , private owners may not be so lucky . `` russian schoolroom '' remains in spielberg 's possession while courts determine the rightful owner , a spokesman for the director said . but art stolen from a los angeles mansion and sold in sweden remains with its swedish purchasers , according to a case file posted on the web site of the los angeles police department 's art theft detail . even though the thief was caught , `` the swedish government refused to return the paintings , claiming that according to swedish law , the auction buyers had purchased the paintings in good faith , '' according to the web site . in the case of rockwell 's `` russian schoolroom , '' someone took it from a gallery in clayton , missouri , a st. louis suburb , in 1973 , according to an fbi synopsis of the case . in 2004 , the fbi 's art crime team found out that the piece had been for sale at a new york rockwell exhibition 15 years earlier and posted a picture and description of the painting on its art recovery web site . spielberg 's staff learned of the search and told the fbi that spielberg had it in his collection in los angeles . he had purchased it from a legitimate dealer in 1989 , an fbi press release said . the agency also determined the painting was auctioned in new orleans in 1988 , but it has yet to determine who took the painting or its whereabouts from 1973 to 1988 . whoever took `` russian schoolroom '' from the suburban st. louis gallery in 1973 , or the masterpieces from the boston museum 1980 , or the works lifted in zurich this week , should n't be mistaken for a high-society , tuxedo-wearing , `` thomas crown affair '' kind of thief , radcliffe said . `` these people are the worst sort of criminal . they are just like the criminals who traffic individuals or sell children , or murder . `` they are thoroughly unpleasant people . there is no romanticism in anyway that should be connected to it .

371	atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it was an image that got the nation talking : two giggling young women in oversized sunglasses robbing a bank . the `` barbie bandits '' helped their hometown earn the dubious distinction as the nation 's bank robbery capital . here one of the so-called `` barbie bandits '' is captured on surveillance video at a surburban atlanta bank . atlanta 's fbi field division topped los angeles in reporting the most bank heists , with 350 for the 12 months ending september 30 , 2007 , according to the fbi , which annually names areas most prone to bank robberies . the los angeles area was no. 2 with 338 heists , followed by philadelphia with 316 . just thursday , two suspects overpowered a security guard at an atlanta , georgia , bank , took his gun , robbed the bank and fled with money in hand , police said . eventually , police shot one of the suspects in an exchange of gunfire . two more armed bank robberies took place in metro atlanta friday . the fbi says violent crime is up across the nation , especially in major metro areas like atlanta . so it 's no surprise atlanta has become a prime target for bank robberies , fbi spokesman stephen emmett told cnn . watch hotlanta or heistlanta ? '' `` this goes hand in hand with those figures , '' emmett said . atlanta 's rapid growth over the last decade has also been a factor . a recent atlanta business chronicle article reported that metro atlanta has 26 more banks than in all of north carolina -- roughly one bank for every 3,500 people in the region . see photos of bank heists in metro atlanta '' `` we would attribute a lot of that -lsb- bank robberies -rsb- to the growth and the fact that the banking industry has matched that growth with an increase in bank branches throughout the area , '' emmett said . atlanta 's rise in bank heists comes just as los angeles has aggressively countered once out-of-control bank robberies . los angeles has gone from more than 500 bank robberies in the mid-2000s to this year 's 338 , the fbi stats show . according to the fbi , its atlanta field division reported 350 bank robberies in the last year -- the most notorious of which were the `` barbie bandits '' and `` grandpa bandit '' robberies . the fbi says 122 of the heists were armed robberies , or robberies where a weapon was visibly used . emmett said many more of the robberies were what law enforcement officers classify as `` note jobs '' -- where a robber gestures as if he or she has a gun on them in a demand note handed over to the teller . also factored into the total number of robberies were atm heists and a record nine armored car robberies . those armored car robberies are particularly disturbing to emmett . `` anyone that would confront an armored car courier knowing that he 's already armed and in somewhat of a defensive posture , that mindset is very troubling for law enforcement , '' he said . while emmett said there is no `` typical '' bank robber , he said he has seen some trends , most notably that they are often people battling drug addictions . he also said bank robbers are often repeat offenders . two recent high-profile cases in atlanta seem to confirm that . two women dubbed the `` barbie bandits '' were arrested after working with a bank employee to rob a bank of america in the atlanta suburb of acworth . they both later admitted to police to having drug addiction problems . recently apprehended 69-year-old bobby joe phillips , dubbed the `` grandpa bandit , '' is suspected to have robbed seven banks in tennessee and the atlanta area and had a criminal history . emmett says typically very little money is taken in a bank heist . joe brannen , president of the georgia bankers association , agrees , saying `` the average is $ 2,000 to $ 3,000 . it 's not as big a payoff as most people think it is . '' with the holidays in full swing , authorities are steeling themselves for a spate of bank robberies with robbers looking for quick holiday cash . `` i would make the assumption that a large part of it is the increased -lsb- financial -rsb- pressures this time of year , '' said brannen . the fbi advises banks to be extra vigilant this time of year and to keep a close eye on jittery individuals donning gloves , hats and sunglasses . but brannen says profiling people like that can be problematic . `` we 've chosen not to go there . here in atlanta , lots of people wear head coverings for religious purposes . this is a free and open society , '' he said . he said customers want to come into a bank unimpeded -- that 99.9 percent are just customers , not bank robbers . brannen says banks do all they can to balance convenience for their customers and the bank 's need for security . `` there is no good , magic solution . '' he says . emmett said as long as metro atlanta continues to grow , so will the number of bank robberies . `` this is something that is part of growth . we have more banks . we have more people . we 're a big city now .

'' but minallah issued an open letter on monday and released the doctors ' clinical notes to distance them from the government statement , and he also talked to cnn . in the letter , minallah said the doctors `` suggested to the officials to perform an autopsy , '' but that saud `` did not agree . '' he noted that under the law , police investigators have `` exclusive responsibility '' in deciding to have an autopsy . minallah told cnn that he was speaking out because the doctors at the hospital were `` threatened . '' `` they are government servants who can not speak ; i am not , '' he said . he did not elaborate on the threats against the doctors . he said the lack of an autopsy has created `` a perception that there is some kind of cover-up , though i might not believe in that theory . '' `` there is a state within the state , and that state within the state does not want itself to be held accountable , '' minallah said . cheema said the government had no objection to bhutto 's body being exhumed for an autopsy if the family requested it . her widower has said the family was against exhumation because it did not trust the government . minallah said the family could not have prevented an autopsy at the hospital without getting an order from a judge . the three-page medical report , which was signed by seven doctors , described bhutto 's head wound , but it did not conclude what caused it . it noted that x-ray images were made after she was declared dead . the wound was described as an irregular oval of about 5 centimeters by 3 centimeters above her right ear . `` sharp bones edges were felt in the wound , '' it read . `` no foreign body was felt in the wound .

378	macau , china -- pete sampras rolled back the years to upset current world number one roger federer in an exhibition match in macau on saturday . sampras enjoyed the spoils of victory in macau after two previous defeats to federer . federer had one the two previous clashes in an asian series in straight sets but was handed a 7-6 6-4 defeat in the finale . american ace sampras downplayed his victory , noting federer was coming off a long season and that he was helped by his big serve and the fast indoor carpet surface . he had only aimed to win one set during the three-match series . `` let 's not get carried away , '' he said at a news conference . sampras ruled out a comeback from retirement , telling the audience after the match , `` i had my time in the 90s . '' federer tried to put on a positive spin on the loss , saying he was n't embarrassed to lose to his idol , but still showed some disappointment . `` it 's been tough beating my idol the last two times . i 'm happy that he got me at least once , '' he said , but adding , `` i hope we can do it again in the future . i 'd like to get him back .

379	dubai -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a court in dubai sentenced two men wednesday to 15 years in prison for the rape and kidnapping of a 15-year-old french boy . veronique robert , mother of the 15-year-old french-swiss teen , speaking outside a court in dubai . the boy 's mother , veronique robert , was visibly upset after the sentence was read and promised to appeal . robert , a french journalist , brought the case to the media 's attention in recent months in an effort to shed light on what she deemed to be injustices in the pro-western emirate of dubai . robert said wednesday 's sentence was too lenient for a crime that she believes is tantamount to attempted murder because one of her son 's attackers was knowingly hiv-positive at the time of the rape . she refrained from asking the death penalty for her son 's attackers , but said she hoped the sentence would be much longer . a spokesman for the dubai government , habib al mulla , told cnn the sentence was in accordance with international standards and was not lenient . `` today 's verdict has proven that the system is efficient and is fair to all parties involved , '' al mulla said . the case began in july , when the two men , 36 and 18 , kidnapped and raped the french teenager at knifepoint . robert contacted french diplomats , who took up the allegations with dubai authorities . al mulla said police action was swift and arrests were made within 24 hours . but robert has said the case was botched from the start , beginning with her son 's examination by a doctor who said her son was gay . homosexuality in dubai is illegal , and the teen could have faced as much as a year in prison . robert 's son has since returned to france and was not in court for wednesday 's sentencing . robert has also said dubai authorities repeatedly concealed evidence -- confirmed in court papers -- that one of the attackers was hiv-positive . robert said her son , who is still awaiting test results to find out whether he has the virus , could have gotten treatment much sooner had they known . dubai authorities deny any evidence was concealed . the case has shed light on dubai 's attitudes toward rape and homosexuality , which some western observers have said is outdated . al mulla , however , said wednesday 's sentencing and the government 's handling of the case proves the country 's system works . `` it 's today 's verdict which proves that there is a system , '' al mulla said . `` the system is working properly . however , if there is any room for any improvement in the system , we 'll definitely look into it , consider it , and if there 's any room for improvement , we 'll implement it . '' the mother has already filed suit in courts in paris and geneva , switzerland seeking compensation from sheikh khalifa , president of the united arab emirates , and the prime minister and vice president of dubai , sheikh mohammed al maktoum . she is also suing others , including the dubai police chief . robert started a web site over the summer , boycottdubai.com , demanding better treatment for children who suffer sexual assault there . at a press conference last month , she proclaimed , `` we are here because i just would like first justice for my son ; and second for every girl and boy who was raped and even had no chance to speak . '' robert said she will drop all her pending cases if the government sets up rape clinics , recognizes the status of rape victims , and takes precautions after rape against sexually-transmitted diseases . in the wake of wednesday 's verdict , robert said a dubai government official told her the emirate plans to open its first rape clinic , which she said was a small victory . the government has not yet officially announced its plans to open such a facility . al mulla told cnn that dubai believes a reception center for rape victims is `` a good solution . '' `` we are considering it , '' he said , regarding robert 's request . `` we believe it 's good . it 's good for the victims , and it 's good for the whole system .

384	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush vetoed an expansion of the federally funded , state-run health insurance program for poor children for a second time wednesday , telling congress the bill `` moves our country 's health care system in the wrong direction . '' in his veto message , president bush calls on congress to extend funding for the current program . in his veto message , bush said the bill is almost a duplicate of the proposal he spiked in october . `` because the congress has chosen to send me an essentially identical bill that has the same problems as the flawed bill i previously vetoed , i must veto this legislation , too , '' he said in a statement released by the white house . the bill would have expanded the state children 's health insurance program by nearly $ 35 billion over five years , the same as the measure bush vetoed october 3 . track recent and historical presidential vetoes '' the president had proposed adding $ 5 billion to the program and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded , state-run program . democratic leaders said the new version addressed republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving schip benefits , capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program and preventing adults from receiving benefits . though the measure had strong bipartisan support , it fell short of the two-thirds majorities needed to override a presidential veto in the house and senate . house minority leader john boehner , r-ohio , said democrats were more interested in scoring political points with the veto than in reaching a compromise with republicans . `` we could have resolved the differences in his program in 10 minutes , if the majority had wanted to resolve the differences , '' boehner said . `` this has become a partisan political game . '' the program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for medicaid -- the federal health insurance program for the poor -- but who ca n't afford private insurance . democrats wanted to extend the program to another 4 million , paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes . `` what a sad day that the president would say that rather than insuring -lsb- millions of -rsb- children , ' i do n't want to raise the cigarette tax , ' '' said house speaker nancy pelosi . she called for a january 23 vote on whether to override the veto . meanwhile , bush called on congress to extend funding for the current program to keep the 6 million now covered on the rolls . e-mail to a friend .

386	santiago , chile -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- chile called home its ambassador in peru on monday , as a dispute flared over disputed maritime territory between the south american neighbors . they have bickered over the rich pacific coast fishing waters for years , and peru published a new map on sunday that pushes its bid to negotiate a new sea border . chile 's government protested the move and said it was calling home its ambassador in peru , cristian barros , for consultations . `` we feel that this type of publication -lrb- map -rrb- and this position certainly make more difficult a fluid bilateral relationship with the peruvian government , '' spokesman ricardo lagos weber said on monday . `` chile will continue to fully exercise its rights and competencies over chilean territory , '' he said . peruvian president alan garcia said in june his country would take chile to the international court at the hague to resolve the case . peru 's foreign minister , jose antonio garcia belaunde , sought to downplay the row . `` it is an absolutely common diplomatic practice in novel situations like this that garner attention that ambassadors are called -lrb- back to report -rrb- , '' he said . `` the channels of dialogue and communication must be kept open , and the countries must work toward a positive agenda , '' garcia belaunde said . the sea border , set in the 1950s , starts close to the land border and cuts due west across the ocean . but peru says it was non-binding and rob it of 14,630 square miles -lrb- 37,900 sq km -rrb- of fishing waters . its proposed border is a southwestern sloping line that follows the diagonal land border into the pacific ocean . analysts say peru will have its day in court and the hague is the only venue for the issue to be resolved , unless something happens to escalate the debate . `` the only thing that could happen , which would be very worrisome , would be if some autonomous group carried out some kind of act of sovereignty -lrb- in those waters -rrb- now that peru officially claims them . that would be a shame , '' said ricardo israel , a political analyst in chile . chile defeated peru in the 1879-1883 war of the pacific and seized a chunk of mineral-rich territory from its northern neighbor . the two countries have strong economic ties but relations are still rocky . the dispute over their sea border has bubbled anew over the past two years and comes in addition to less serious disputes over the origins of everything from a dessert and a fruit to pisco , a grape liquor . peru and chile are the world 's top producers of fish meal , a cattle feed , and fishing is one of the engines of peru 's economy . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .

if you think you know it , shout it out . was it : a -rrb- 1997 , b -rrb- 1999 , c -rrb- 2001 or d -rrb- 2003 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! if you guessed c , you 've got the right tune . the popular portable players first made the scene in the fall of 2001 . that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! tech in the classroom . azuz : whether it 's an ipod , sony , samsung or zune , it seems like you ca n't go anywhere these days without seeing people plugged in to some type of mp3 player . and if you 're on a college campus , you might think students walking around with their ear buds in are listening to music . but do n't be fooled . they could just be studying up for class . -lrb- begin video clip -rrb- . azuz : walk around any college campus and those famous white earplugs seem to be everywhere . but sometimes the playlist is n't quite what you 'd expect . lectures on computer science instead of american idol . not so much sum 41 as history 101 . some teachers have used the audio ipod in their lessons , but at the georgia institute of technology , professor jim foley hopes to transfer his visual web lectures to the video ipod . professor foley , user interface design teacher : the students who did web lectures earned grades that were about 10 % better -- we did that three years ago . azuz : as mp3 players become essential parts of students ' lives , they have the potential to rival the laptop as learning tools in the classroom . with a graduate student 's help , foley records lectures before class , so that students can raise questions when they arrive . students from foley 's user interface design course say they find it valuable to review lectures when convenient . kathy pham , student in professor foley 's user interface design class : it takes 15 minutes to walk from one side of campus to the other side of campus . and to be able just to download the mp3 to my ipod and just walk across campus , would be very beneficial . scott gilliland , student in professor foley 's user interface design class : a lot of people ca n't get to a full desktop computer whenever they need to listen to the lectures , and it 's nice to be able to take them with you . azuz : although students show enthusiasm towards mp3 players , there are limitations because they 're small . foley : the screen resolution is smaller and navigating between pages will be a little bit slower than on the computer because on the computer i just use the mouse . with the ipod i have to use the scrollwheel and scroll around . azuz : like the laptop , the mp3 player is a popular and revolutionary way to gather and disseminate information . regardless of what teachers decide to use , players and laptops will remain allies . besides , you need a laptop to operate an ipod and vice versa . -lrb- end video clip -rrb- . podcast promo . azuz : and if downloading lectures is n't enough , we 've got another cool thing you can do with an mp3 player : watch cnn student news ! that 's right , you can download our podcast at cnnstudentnews.com or at itunes . so you wo n't miss out on the news when you 're on the go . now and then . ramsay : with cell phones , thin is in . but you had to flex some muscle to handle its oversized ancestor . an ipod can hold your whole music library . but a vintage walkman let you jam out one cassette at a time . microchips keep getting smaller and smaller . but old school computers took up a lot more space . and game controllers have buttons for every possible move . but the retro version ? one button , one joystick , tons of fun . learning with technology . azuz : it 's not just slimmer cell phones and smaller computers . advances in technology are changing the world we live in all the time . and one of the places where those changes are taking place is schools . so we talked to some students and experts to hear what they have to say about teaching with tech . -lrb- begin video clip -rrb- . trina davis , president , international society for technology in education : we started off , when we were first starting to integrate technology , kind of at that basic level . matthew lewis , junior , greenside high school : we of course use laptops and computers . each teacher is assigned a laptop . and also , we have computer labs and a media center with computers inside . don knezek , ceo , international society for technology in education : certainly just dropping technology into a learning environment does n't necessarily improve it unless you are sure that the activities that you are doing align with the expectations that you have for learning . ammarah mahmoud , junior , salem high school : i think many careers today require for people to know how to use technology , so it 's important to learn that in school . knezek : so you ca n't convince me that a student without basic fundamental technology skills is on equal footing for employment . mahmoud : i do n't think schooling should be technology dependent , because i think that , at the same time , we should n't rely on something that does n't have a mind of its own . knezek : you can certainly abuse technology . you can abuse the printed word . you can abuse access to external resources . certainly if teachers and school leaders and parents use the same standards that they would use for any resource for technologies , then we 're in fine shape . lewis : i can see people in the future having something where you just scan , and all of your , you know , personal information comes up and everything about you can come up on a screen , and i think that 's really cool . davis : customization , very innovative , lots of gaming , lots of 3-dimensional spaces and just social spaces that feed on the needs of young learners . -lrb- end video clip -rrb- . goodbye . azuz : and that is the last word in this special edition of cnn student news . we 'll see you back here soon for our next summer show . and of course we thank you for watching everyone . i 'm carl azuz . e-mail to a friend .

389	algiers , algeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- rescuers are sifting through the rubble of the united nations headquarters in algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building 's facade and leveled nearby u.n. offices . rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building . it was one of two suspected car bombs that struck algiers within 10 minutes of each other . the death toll is unclear : the official government count is at least 26 , but hospital sources in algiers told cnn affiliate bfm-tv that 76 people were killed in the two blasts . a statement from the united nations said 45 people were reported killed . algerian interior minister noureddine yazid zerhouni blamed a militant islamic group with ties to al qaeda for the attacks , which also targeted a building housing algeria 's constitutional council and supreme court . in a posting on an islamist web site , the group al qaeda islamic maghreb claimed responsibility . cnn could not immediately corroborate that claim , but the web site is known to carry messages , claims and videos from al qaeda and other militant groups . in the posting , the bombers were identified as sheikh ibrahim abu othman and abdel rahman abu abdel nasser al-asimi . it said two trucks were filled with `` no less than 800 kg -lrb- 1,763 pounds -rrb- of explosives . '' the group called the operation `` another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood , defending the wounded islamic nation and in defiance to the crusaders and their agents , the slaves of america and the sons of france . '' at least 10 u.n. staffers were among those killed , according to u.n. spokeswoman marie okabe . the offices of the un high commissioner for refugees -- located across the street from the u.n. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. -lrb- 3:30 a.m. et -rrb- tuesday . `` our offices are basically destroyed now , nothing works , '' unhcr spokesman ron redmond said from its geneva headquarters . watch his full interview . he said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped u.n. workers . `` it 's a very serious situation still with the u.n. in algiers , '' he said . in a strongly worded statement , u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon condemned what he called `` an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity 's highest ideals under the u.n. banner . '' `` the perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by algerian authorities and the international community , '' ban said in the written statement . he said he has sent senior advisers and other top u.n. officials to head to algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort . most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the constitutional council -- which oversees elections -- and supreme court in the algiers neighborhood of ben aknoun , according to the state-run algeria press agency . that blast struck a bus outside the targeted building , killing many of those on board , the news agency reported . one man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him . `` i saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me . i had to run away from the car , '' he said . zerhouni said the attack was the work of the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , the same group that took responsibility for an attack in april in downtown algiers that killed 33 people . that group also uses the name al qaeda islamic maghreb after merging with al qaeda earlier this year . it abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al qaeda . cnn international security correspondent paula newton said the merger combined the expertise of algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al qaeda in north africa , enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of algiers . she said the group 's goal is to destabilize countries like algeria , morocco and tunisia , which it sees as enemies of the islamic state . zerhouni said police interrogations of gspc members arrested in the wake of the april attack revealed that algeria 's constitutional council and supreme court were on a list of gspc targets . algeria , which has a population of 33 million , is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an islamist party was poised to win . tens of thousands of people died in the unrest . although the country has remained relatively peaceful , recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence . e-mail to a friend .

394	yellowstone national park , montana -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the gray wolf was officially removed from the endangered species act 's `` threatened '' list friday after three decades -- a decision that has stoked controversy among environmentalists and ranchers . federal officials estimate there are 1,500 gray wolves in yellowstone national park . it means the wolves can be shot and killed once they step out of yellowstone national park as soon as the affected states establish a hunting season . however , state fish and wildlife officials can shoot the animals whenever they deem the wolves to be a problem . the government delisted the wolves -- which were eliminated from yellowstone decades ago before being reintroduced in the 1990s -- because they are now thriving in the park that is dominated by bison , elk and bighorn sheep . `` they 're back here in the northern rockies ; they 're back here in yellowstone , '' said doug smith , a biologist for the national park service in yellowstone . `` that 's something to celebrate given their history of human hatred . '' but not everyone is happy about the animal being removed from the endangered list . conservationists believe hundreds of gray wolves straying from yellowstone in search of prey could soon be killed by hunters and ranchers . watch rancher say no wolf is `` sacred '' '' `` we 're not ready to pop the champagne corks and have a party , '' said doug honnold , the managing attorney for earthjustice , a non-profit environmental law firm based in oakland , california , that has threatened to sue the government . `` my biggest fear is we 're going to go backwards instead of forwards . '' it would n't be the first time . in the early 20th century , wolves were the targets of a massive government extermination campaign . `` it 's harder to find an animal more persecuted than wolves . ... we did wolf extermination with a vengeance , '' said smith . but attitudes began to change in the 1980s . elk and bison populations increased dramatically because there was no natural predator to keep their numbers in check . in 1995 , smith led a team to bring wolves back to the rocky mountain landscape . they transplanted dozens of wolves to yellowstone from canada . see photos of yellowstone 's animals '' the project has been regarded as an overwhelming success . there are now more than 1,500 wolves across wyoming , idaho and montana , according to the government . that number convinced federal wildlife officials to remove them from the endangered species list . federal officials require each of the three states to maintain a population of 100 wolves , meaning a total of 300 wolves across all three states . the states have actually pledged to keep the population higher than that , at a rate of 150 wolves per state . `` we did a thorough analysis , '' said ed bangs , the wolf recovery coordinator for the u.s. fish and wildlife service . `` the consensus -lsb- for recovery -rsb- is a population of 300 wolves and 30 breeding pairs . '' he added , `` the wolf population is fully recovered . we have more wolves than we ever predicted and we have fewer problems than we ever predicted . '' earthjustice says that 's not nearly enough to ensure a viable population and they want to stop the delisting . `` we 're going to have hundreds of wolves die needlessly , '' said honnold . but many ranchers in the region just do n't understand the fuss about the animals . they have complained for years that the wolves eat their livestock . `` there 's nothing about a wolf that 's sacred , '' said bruce malcolm , a cattle rancher and republican member of montana 's house of representatives . he said he 's lost nearly two dozen cows to the wolves in recent years . `` i would have preferred that they never came here , '' he said . if there 's a winner with the controversy , it 's yellowstone . the wolves have pushed up attendance by more than a 100,000 visitors per year , according to a park study . smith , who has dedicated his life to the wolves , is philosophical about the debate . `` no one says living with wolves is easy , '' said smith . `` living with wolves is a compromise .

'' beijing has blamed the dalai lama and his followers for violence that erupted amid protests for tibetan independence earlier this month , but china has drawn international criticism for its crackdown on the protests that began peacefully . president bush said friday he `` urged restraint '' during a phone conversation with chinese president hu jintao earlier this week , and noted `` that it 's in his country 's interest '' for the government to have representatives `` sit down again with representatives of the dalai lama .

'' the protests -- which began on the 49th anniversary of a failed tibetan uprising -- have threatened to overshadow beijing 's role as host of the summer olympic games in august . in his statement , the dalai lama complained the chinese state-run media 's coverage `` of the recent events in tibet , using deceit and distorted images , could sow the seeds of racial tension with unpredictable long-term consequences . this is of grave concern to me .

399	havana , cuba -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- cuban president raul castro is taking over leadership of a country whose government believes its citizens are not working hard enough . raul castro was chosen sunday to take over cuba 's presidency from his brother , fidel castro . the state-run newspaper recently ran an article headlined `` work : option or necessity ? '' the writer pointed out that , judging by the number of people in the streets during the day , many cubans do n't seem to be on the job . they have few motivations to buckle down : salaries average about $ 15 per month on the island , and cubans get monthly food rations even if they do n't work . watch a report on the realities in cuba '' `` there is a strong desire to protect and to gradually increase the incomes and savings of the population , particularly of those least favored , '' said raul castro , 76 . the black market is so widespread that cubans have coined a special term for breaking the law to make ends meet : `` resolver '' -- literally , `` to resolve . '' see cuba through i-reporters ' eyes '' the new president , who took the reins of power sunday from his ailing brother , fidel , 81 , has said the country must become more productive . `` the country 's priority will be to meet the basic needs of the population , both material and spiritual , based on the sustained strengthening of the national economy and its productive basis without which , i 'll say it again , development would be impossible , '' raul castro said in a speech sunday . cubans , too , are calling for reforms , though not all of them related to productivity . in a recent video that has made the rounds on the internet , a student poses tough questions to the president of cuba 's national assembly , asking why cubans can not travel freely to resorts -- a practice derided by critics as `` tourist apartheid . '' though such a public display of discontent is rare , the video echoed sentiments often voiced in private for years , particularly since the fall of the soviet empire in 1991 and , with it , the loss of billions of dollars in subsidies . cuban officials counter that cubans are not granted access to the nation 's most luxurious spots because they do not have the foreign exchange brought by the tourists and needed to run the country 's social programs , such as free health care and education . with a new president steering the island nation for the first time in 49 years , some cubans have allowed their expectations to rise . `` i think those expectations are really very large indeed and it 'll be the achilles heel , potentially , of this new government if it does n't attack them with some vigor , '' said hal klepak , a professor of history and warfare studies at the royal military college of canada in kingston , ontario . indeed , castro has promised to move within a few weeks to improve efficiency by cutting some of the red tape that can frustrate the most fervent of revolutionaries . but wayne s. smith , a senior fellow at the center for international policy in washington and chief of the u.s. interests section in havana from 1979 to 1982 , predicted sunday in an editorial in the atlanta journal-constitution that raul castro will not break strongly from his brother 's policies . `` rather , we will see a peaceful transition and the existing system remain largely intact , '' smith predicted . still , changes are inevitable , he said . `` raul castro has called for a nationwide debate on the country 's economic future and for cubans to propose reforms in group discussions . `` he has also called for new proposals to raise productivity , including discussion of more private ownership of land . the cuban people want change , want reforms that will bring about a better way of life . '' smith credited the younger castro 's leadership over the past 1 1/2 years , while serving as acting president , with having already resulted in `` a greater openness , and open criticism of certain government programs . '' but the degree of change remains uncertain , as does the possibility that `` even from the shadow fidel will try to discourage reforms , '' he said , adding `` the prognosis , nonetheless , is hopeful . '' see a timeline of castro 's rise to power '' the u.s. government 's former man in havana recommended current politicians exert pressure on the island with a light touch . `` we could accomplish far more by reducing tensions and beginning a meaningful dialogue , '' he said . `` raul castro has several times suggested such a dialogue . why not take him up on it ? we have disagreements , yes , but how do we resolve them without talking ?

401	-lrb- aol autos -rrb- -- do you live in one of the nation 's worst cities for road rage ? if you live in a major metropolitan area on either coast , chances are you do . if you live in the midwest or northwest , odds are that you do n't . miami ranks as the worst city for most aggressive drivers for the second straight year in a nationwide study of driver habits followed by new york , boston , los angeles and washington . but if road rage is a `` cultural phenomenon '' as one of our experts suggests , how best do we go about combating driver frustration across the nation ? traffic black spots . the nation 's roads are peppered with traffic black spots , junctions where car snarls elicit road rage in even the most mild-mannered drivers . southern california has the san diego -lrb- i-405 -rrb- freeway , and the nation 's busiest junction , where u.s. 101 meets it to the north of los angeles . miami and the east coast have i-95 , which snakes from the world 's busiest cruise port up to maine . the district of columbia and the beltway are infamous for gridlock . i 've spent three very nervous hours getting to chicago 's o'hare airport from the city center -lrb- before missing my flight -rrb- . traffic by definition is worst in major metropolitan areas -- if your farming community is gridlocked , you 'd better be grousing at your local council meetings -- but it is the increase in traffic that leads many to suggest it 's just going to get worse . traffic levels are rising seemingly as fast as home foreclosures in los angeles and miami . in these areas , it 's not only the rise in number of drivers , but the rising age of drivers . aaa points out that seniors are the fastest growing demographic in the u.s. . that suggests drivers should adjust their habits accordingly . aaa has launched its lifelong safe mobility campaign to help seniors adjust to more crowded roads and perhaps more aggressive drivers . the facts and remedy . when the aaa foundation for traffic safety studied more than 10,000 incidents of road rage and violent aggressive driving committed in the 1990s , it found that at least 218 people were killed and another 12,610 injured when drivers got angry . many of these aggressors are males aged 18 to 26 . the aaa web site offers a three-step plan to avoid becoming the victim of aggressive driving : . • the first tip is `` do n't offend , '' which includes cutting off other drivers , driving slowly in the left lane , tailgating and gesturing to other drivers . • the agency then warns to `` not engage , '' which advises steering clear of trouble , not making eye contact and getting help , by calling 911 , in the event of experiencing dangerous , aggressive driving . it then asks at-risk drivers to `` adjust their attitude , '' which involves `` forgetting winning '' -lrb- for the drivers to whom driving is a darwinian survival of the fittest -rrb- , or putting themselves in the other drivers ' shoes . • finally , they recommend that , if you think you have a road rage problem , seek professional help . other people 's actions . so the wife and i were looking for sofas . it was a sunday morning and , with me behind the wheel , we were dawdling around quiet streets trying to find one of those seemingly ubiquitous furniture warehouses . soon , the wife pointed one out but we were almost past it . i hit the brakes and quickly pulled in , then realized that a mercedes m-class had pulled in right behind me . a large , squat tattooed guy jumped out and started shouting , about 10 feet from my car . `` i have children in the car , i had to slam on the brakes , -lsb- how dare -rsb- you brake so quickly , '' he said , getting real mean . i appreciated i 'd probably braked quickly and that it was bad driving on my part . however , as his tirade continued , i very calmly asked why he was setting such a bad example for his young children by following another driver off the road , then shouting and swearing . the man continued his harangue before climbing back into his vehicle and driving away . the next time you 're fulminating in your front seat about another 's aggressive driving , remember that your driving will almost inevitably elicit the same response in someone else . and do n't swear in front of your kids or set a bad example for them . ` cultural phenomenon ' dr. leon james is a professor of psychology at the university of hawaii and web master of drdriving.org . he is also the co-author of `` road rage and aggressive driving '' with this wife , diane nahl . james began studying driving psychology about 20 years ago after his wife told him her mother thought he took turns too fast . over a period of self-study , he said he was amazed by the mistakes he made and the aggressive thoughts he experienced toward other drivers . he recorded them via his `` speakaloud '' method . using his method on students , he discovered that road rage is a `` cultural phenomenon . '' `` we call the back seat of the car the ` road rage nursery ' , where -lsb- young children -rsb- pick up all the driver 's bad habits , '' james said . `` it 's a cultural temper tantrum . '' james said `` local norms '' can play a part . for example , florida drivers yell at each other more than in california , where verbal interplay can be interpreted as road rage in a criminal court . but , in the main , it 's `` drivers trying to deal with their emotions in stressful situations . '' james said that , in his studies , an awareness gap exists in aggressive drivers : when asked about drivers ' habits , respondents suggested that about 85 percent of other drivers drove aggressively , while just 35 percent said they themselves drove aggressively . if you feel your blood boiling frequently behind the wheel , classes like james ' are sprouting all over the nation . addressing road rage . in an ideal world , an increase in drivers would automatically be met by an improvement in infrastructure , and fewer road-rage-inducing distractions . another utopian ideal is for everyone else to drive more considerately . one look at our nation 's crumbling roads tells us that this fantasyland clearly does n't exist . instead of looking outside your car at road conditions or the habits of other drivers , the answer to aggressive driving , most likely , lies within the confines of your own cabin . e-mail to a friend .

404	cairo , egypt -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- omar bin laden has a message for his father , osama : `` find another way . '' omar bin laden says he last saw his father in 2000 when the son decided to leave al qaeda . the son of the most-wanted man in the world spoke sunday to cnn in a quiet , middle-class suburb about an hour outside cairo , egypt . omar bin laden , who works as a contractor , said he is talking publicly because he wants an end to the violence his father has inspired -- violence that has killed innocent civilians in a spate of attacks around the world , including those of september 11 , 2001 . `` i try and say to my father : ` try to find another way to help or find your goal . this bomb , this weapons , it 's not good to use it for anybody , ' '' he said in english learned in recent months from his british wife . he said that 's not just his own message , but one that a friend of his father 's and other muslims have expressed to him . `` they too say ... my father should change -lsb- his -rsb- way , '' he said . watch whether omar bin laden thinks his father will ever be caught '' he said he has n't spoken to his father since 2000 , when he walked away from an al qaeda training camp in afghanistan with his father 's blessings . he said he has no idea where his father is , but is confident he will never be caught because locals support him . asked if his father might be living along the afghan-pakistan border , he said , `` maybe , maybe not . '' `` either way , the people there are different , '' he said . `` they do n't care about the government . '' now , he and his wife are preparing to launch a movement far different from the one his father , osama bin laden , launched . they are pursuing a movement for peace . at first glance , omar bin laden appears to have little in common with the man who has eluded international efforts to find him . the 26-year-old 's hair is bound in neat braids , he drives a jeep and is married to a british national twice his age . but the physical resemblance quickly sinks in , even without the long beard his father favors . it is a resemblance he does n't avoid . `` being osama 's son , i do n't hide it . i do n't hide my name , '' he said . `` i am proud by my name , but if you have a name like mine you will find people run away from you , are afraid of you . '' he said he does n't consider his father to be a terrorist . when his father was fighting the soviets , washington considered him a hero , he said . `` before they call it war ; now they call it terrorism , '' he said . he said his father believes his duty is to protect muslims from attack . `` he believes this is his job -- to help the people , '' he said . `` i do n't think my father is a terrorist because history tells you he 's not . '' however , omar bin laden -- who was 14 when he began training in al qaeda camps -- said he differs greatly with his father over the killing of civilians . was 9/11 a just attack ? `` i do n't think 9/11 was right personally , but it happened , '' he said . `` i do n't think ... -lsb- the war -rsb- in vietnam was right . i do n't think what 's going on in palestine is right . i do n't think what 's going on in iraq is right . `` if we make what is right and not right , we will make a very big list , '' he said . he said he left al qaeda because he did not want to be associated with killing civilians . he said his father did not try to dissuade him from leaving al qaeda . `` i told him i was going , and wanted to try life and see what it was like outside because , from a young age i was with my father , and i only saw and heard my father and his friends . my father told me , ` if this is what your choice -- your decision -- is , what can i tell you ? i like you to be with me , but this is your decision . ' '' so father and son went their separate ways . but there has been no running from the bin laden name , not after the events of september 11 . on that day , omar bin laden was in saudi arabia , where 15 of the 19 hijackers were from . asked if , upon learning of the news , he knew his father had been behind it , he replied , `` yeah , maybe . '' he said he felt sadness for those killed . `` i do n't think 9/11 was right personally , '' he said . `` i do n't agree with 9/11 or with any war where only civilians are dying . '' asked why he did not protest more strongly his father 's role in the killing of civilians , he said it is up to the religious clerics close to his father to tell osama bin laden to change tactics in the name of islam . and even if that most unlikely scenario were to occur , he said , al qaeda would not stop . `` my father does n't have the power to stop the movement at this moment . '' sitting by his side throughout the hour-and-a-half interview was his wife , zaina . the two are organizing a multi-month horserace through north africa in the name of peace , set to kick off this year . but getting sponsors to line up behind the name bin laden has been difficult . `` it would probably have been easier to do a race without having omar 's name , but then the race would just be a race , it would n't be a race for peace , '' his wife said . omar bin laden said his relationship with his father was limited . he is the fourth of 11 children born to his father 's first wife , and he is one of 19 children osama bin laden has fathered . `` most of the time he busy , so busy , all the day he 's busy -lsb- with -rsb- his friends . he was working a lot . '' omar bin laden is now undertaking perhaps an impossible task : trying to rebrand the name they share . but he said he is not looking for approval from his father . `` my life , i take care of my life , '' he said . `` my father he take care of his life .

405	washington -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- the democratic-led congress yielded to president bush on saturday and approved legislation to temporarily expand government 's power to conduct electronic surveillance without a court order in tracking foreign suspects . president bush demanded congress expand his surveillance authority before leaving for vacation . civil liberties groups charged the measure would create a broad net that would sweep up law-abiding u.s. citizens . but the house of representatives gave its concurrence to the bill , 227-183 , a day after it won senate approval , 60-28 . the action came amid warnings of possible attacks on the united states . `` after months of prodding by house republicans , congress has finally closed the terrorist loophole in our surveillance law -- and america will be the safer for it , '' declared house minority leader john boehner , an ohio republican . `` we think it is not the bill that ought to pass , '' said house majority leader steny hoyer . but he conceded he and fellow democrats were unable to stop the measure in this national security showdown with the white house . `` protecting america is our most solemn obligation , '' bush said earlier in the day in urging congress to send him the bill so he could sign it into law . watch kelli arena 's report on what some call an intelligence gap '' the measure would authorize the national security agency to intercept without a court order communications between people in the united states and foreign targets overseas . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .
406	-lrb- aol autos -rrb- -- okay , you 've decided what model of car you want to buy . and you know , more or less , how much you want to spend -- or how much you can afford . you 've kicked tires , talked to salesmen , taken a few shiny new numbers for a test-drive and you 're ready to make the deal . if you eat in your car you may want to consider fabric or leather protections . except , you 're not quite done . you still need to decide whether to buy any of those `` extras '' that your salesperson will always suggest . some of these extras have real value and are probably worth adding . others ... maybe not so much . the list of `` extras '' offered by most dealers , may include paint sealant , fabric protection/leather care , extended warranties , extended ` one price ' service contracts , rust/underbody coatings and anti-theft systems , to mention a few . we wanted to know which of these new car extras were worth it and which ones a consumer can do without . to get to the bottom of it , we thought we would consult an expert -- david bennett , manager of automotive programs for aaa . as it turns out , like most things in life , the answer often just comes down to what 's best for you , depending on your own situation , budget or locale . let 's address these add-ons one by one : . paint sealant . `` i think that most paint jobs on cars are pretty good these days , so in most cases you probably do n't need that anymore , '' said bennett , who offered one caveat . `` but that can depend on what part of the country you live in -- what the climate is , whether you get a lot of snow and ice , and what the road crews put down on the road -- whether it is salt , or if it is something that is less harmful to the paint . but generally , as long as you keep your car washed , and wash that salt off of it , and get it waxed regularly , that paint should last without getting the ` add-on ' sealer at the dealership . also , if you get a chip or a ding , get it fixed so the rust does n't get a chance to set in and spread . '' fabric / leather protection . these extras are fairly self-explanatory -- the dealer `` treats '' the upholstered or leather seating with a `` protection '' product that make the seats more resistant to stains or scuff marks . `` this can be a good purchase , but the first question you should ask before buying it is , ` what kind of lifestyle do i lead ? ' suggests bennett . `` do you have a lot of kids and are they prone to spill things ? or is your vehicle mostly going to be occupied by adults ? '' do you eat in the car with some regularity ? if so , and you 're just too darn messy for your own good , a stain protection might be a good way to go . `` also , look at exclusions in the plan , '' advises bennett . `` if you 're a smoker , and the plan excludes burn holes from cigarette ashes , and you 're not diligent about making sure your ash is always short , that might not be a good purchase because of that exclusion . each of these policies or plans is probably offering something different , and you need to read all of the exclusions before making that purchase , because it might not be a good one for you . '' if you want to save some cash , one option would be to forego the protectant and just make sure you clean your seats regularly with a good upholstery cleaner or leather cleaner . to remove spots from a leather seat , use a good leather cleaner and work it into the spot with a soft cloth . if the spot still remains , let it sit for a few hours . repeat , as they say , if necessary . it 's also a good idea , to use a leather conditioner regularly on leather seats to restore moisture and to maintain its appearance . rustproofing . this is when the dealership applies various rust-inhibiting chemicals , waxes or sealers to the vehicle 's undercarriage . it can also be applied to other rust-prone areas . rustproofing treatments sometimes include a guarantee over a certain number of years . keep in mind that some guarantees require annual `` checkups '' to re-apply the sealers or rust inhibitors to any areas where the rustproofing may have been damaged . `` i do n't think this is necessary in most cases , '' opines bennett . `` the way most vehicles are constructed today , they are not nearly as prone to underbody rusting as they used to be in the old days -- even in the north , where they get a lot of snow . '' lojack car security system / anti-theft systems : . the folks at lojack car security systems report that a vehicle is stolen every 25 seconds in the u.s. using a car alarm is one way to protect your vehicle . but if you want to go the more high-tech `` tracking '' route , using a security system like lojack may give you more peace of mind . the lojack system , includes a small radio frequency transceiver hidden in up to 20 different places in the vehicle . the system uses a code that is tied into the vehicle identification number -lrb- vin -rrb- . then , when you report that your car has been stolen , the state police crime computer can match code against the state vin database . this automatically activates the lojack system in the vehicle -- emitting an inaudible signal . then , police cruisers and aviation units that have the lojack tracking system can identify the vehicle 's location , track it and recover it . lojack claims that over 200,000 vehicles have been recovered worldwide using their system , with over 100,000 of those in the u.s. `` whether or not this is a purchase you should make depends on various factors . if you live in a high-crime area , a system like this could provide you with peace of mind , '' advises bennett . `` but even if you live in a safe , low-crime district , your car can still be stolen from a busy downtown street or parking garage , '' he notes . one caveat : some car owners may not want their car back after it has been stolen , especially if it has been seriously vandalized , or if it has been driven so hard that it causes some mechanical problems . another thing to consider is that owners of gm vehicles that come with its patented onstar system , probably wo n't need a theft tracking program , says bennett . `` because the system allows onstar operators to track the location of the vehicle if it is stolen . so if you buy a gm car with the onstar system , you may want to pass on a lojack or similar tracking system . '' extended warranties . `` this really does depend on how long you plan to keep the vehicle , because most of these extended warranty plans do n't kick in until the manufacturer 's warranty expires , '' advises bennett . `` and these days , those manufacturers warranties are three or five years , sometimes longer . `` so if you plan on selling the car after three or five years , it probably does n't make sense to buy the extended warranty . '' some warranties offer transferable policies , which let you `` sell '' the warranty along with the vehicle . others allow you to `` return '' the warranty for a pro-rated refund . bennett also explains that not all warranties are created equal . `` they usually have three levels of warranties : a basic extended warranty will just cover the powertrain , for example ; while a better one will cover the powertrain plus some other components that are listed -- or an ` exclusionary ' extended warranty may say it covers everything except those items that are listed . at the top end , the best warranty just covers everything , but that is also the most expensive . '' bennett gives an example of one manufacturers warranty . `` for a 2007 buick , the basic manufacturers warranty is five years or 100,000 miles for the powertrain coverage , and the corrosion warranty is six years or 100,000 miles . in fact , that 's the same warranty gm offers on their chevy and cadillac brands . '' `` that 's a pretty good warranty , so if you plan on only keeping your vehicle for five years or less , the extended warranty is probably money you do n't need to spend . '' e-mail to a friend .

408	greencreek , idaho -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it was just 2 1/2 years ago when elaine sonnen found out that her 16-year-old son , richard , had been planning a columbine-style attack at his high school . richard sonnen spent 16 months in mental health institutions after plotting to kill his high school classmates . it would be a fitting payback to his high school classmates who richard said relentlessly bullied him . `` i always wanted to get back at them , '' richard sonnen said of his classmates . `` i always wanted to strangle them . ... i was always mad . i was always angry and i would come home and cry to mom and dad . '' both richard and elaine sonnen spoke to cnn at the 45-acre family farm . unlike columbine and recent school shootings at northern illinois university and virginia tech , elaine sonnen did see the warning signs in her son and was able to stop him . elaine and her husband , tom , adopted richard from a bulgarian orphanage when he was just 4 1/2 years old . `` i mean , we just loved him , and he was just a big sparkle of life , '' she said . but only a few months after they brought him home , they began to see another side of their son . he was angry and unpredictable . elaine sonnen says that at age 6 , richard told her he wanted to kill her . she said he would shake with anger to the point that he 'd scream at her , telling her he wanted to destroy her . `` people thought he was just the greatest kid in the world . very polite , well-mannered , caring , '' elaine sonnen remembered . `` at home , he could be anywhere from just a really helpful kid to a monster . a terrifying monster . '' mother says son had ` two ' personalities '' in junior high , he said , `` evil '' classmates started picking on him . boys and girls , he said , bullied him until he could n't take it anymore . `` i always wanted to get revenge , '' he said . by the eighth grade , richard was put on anti-psychotic medications . he had been diagnosed as bipolar and was suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and other disorders . in 1999 , when the columbine shootings happened , the sonnens feared that richard might do the same thing one day . `` we stopped and looked at each other and said , ` this could be richard ; some day this could be him , ' '' elaine sonnen said . years later , during his junior year in high school , they were right . fed up with the bullies , richard says , he felt like an outcast and started looking for a way to get even . secretly , he began reading books about columbine in his school library . the shooters , eric harris and dylan klebold , became his heroes . `` they planned it out so perfectly and so meticulously ... that i just , wow , you know , '' he said . `` they 're my gods . '' watch a preview of `` campus rage '' '' he even created a hit list of the classmates he planned to kill at prairie high school in cottonwood , idaho . `` my plan was to set around bombs around the school . ... i analyzed a lot of where everybody sat and where everybody did their thing , '' he said . `` i had pinpoints of where i wanted to go , where i wanted to do it . '' harvard medical school psychologist william pollack , who consulted on a 2002 federal government study of school shootings , said it found that most school shooters often had feelings of anger , sadness and isolation as well as homicidal and suicidal thoughts . `` we see a young man who obviously is telling us how depressed he was , how angry he was and how much he looked up to people who we know are very disturbed and very dangerous , and how close he came to killing people , '' said pollack , who watched cnn 's interview with richard . elaine sonnen found out about her son 's plan during a conversation with him . she ordered him to write down the names of the eight students he wanted dead and then gave the list to his caseworker the next day . later , he added a teacher and his mother and sister to the hit list . she took immediate action and had her son committed to an idaho mental institution . over the next 16 months , he received treatment at several mental health facilities throughout idaho . `` there , i opened up . i felt better . i moved on with myself , '' richard said . `` they felt at that point ... they had done everything they could do for him , '' elaine sonnen added . `` he was doing great . he could make it on his own . they had no question . '' in january 2007 , after almost a year and a half in mental institutions , richard sonnen started a new life at lewis-clark state college in lewiston , idaho . he was taking a cocktail of three anti-psychotic drugs to help him function . '' -lsb- for -rsb- the first time in 12 years , i was able to hold my son , '' said elaine sonnen . `` so i knew he was on the road to be well . '' everything seemed to be looking up , but in april 2007 , three days after the virginia tech massacre , richard 's mother received a call from police . they told her richard had made about four threats to carry out shootings at lewis clark state college and lewiston high school . police told her richard planned to go home , get some guns and go back to school to pull off a sniper attack from a clock tower on the college 's campus , she said . police took him into protective custody and searched his apartment for clues . but , in the end , he was released because , authorities say , they did n't have enough evidence to charge him with a crime . richard said the whole incident was a big misunderstanding . he said he was telling people about his high school plot and never threatened his college or local high school . but his mother does n't believe his version of the story . `` no . i believe he made those threats , '' she said . `` i still believe it . '' richard , now 19 , signed an order banning him from campus for one year . today , he lives on his own in washington state . he 's still on medication but not seeing a psychiatrist . since he 's over the age of 18 , his mom ca n't force him to go . is elaine sonnen still afraid of her son ? `` yeah , at times , i 'm very afraid , '' she said . `` because he still has a lot of anger towards me . '' she said the signs are still there , and she fears what could happen if he ever stops taking his medicine . `` he 's not getting the help and the insight from a professional that could see the signs , '' she said . `` because as a person with a mental illness , you have skewed thinking . '' even though richard calls her the `` greatest person in the world , '' elaine sonnen protects the family by keeping an alarm on her son 's bedroom door when he comes home to visit . so why are richard sonnen and his mother , elaine , speaking out now ? in the wake of the northern illinois university and virginia tech shootings , richard wants young people experiencing the same symptoms he had to seek out help . his mother wants parents and authorities to listen for warning signs and to act fast and decisively . e-mail to a friend .

'' the report says the united states , the government of iraq and the international community are n't doing enough to address the daily problems faced by the 2.7 million internally displaced iraqis , who have fled homes in war-torn regions to other places in iraq . those people find themselves unemployed in their new locations and many times unable to access food and health care . `` as a result of the vacuum created by the failure of both the iraqi government and the international community to act in a timely and adequate manner , non-state actors play a major role in providing assistance to vulnerable iraqis , '' the report says . social services are being provided by `` militias of all denominations '' that want to build their groups , with muqtada al-sadr 's political movement using a hezbollah model to set itself up `` as the main service provider in the country . '' hezbollah , the lebanese shiite militant group labeled a terrorist group by the united states , has built a large base of support with its social service network . `` similarly , other shiite and sunni groups are gaining ground and support through the delivery of food , oil , electricity , clothes and money to the civilians living in their fiefdoms . `` not only do these militias now have a quasi-monopoly in the large-scale provision of assistance in iraq , they are also recruiting an increasing number of civilians to their militias -- including displaced iraqis , '' the report said . the report says al-sadr 's militia , the mehdi army , has resettled displaced iraqis `` free of charge in homes that belonged to sunnis . '' `` it provides stipends , food , heating oil , cooking oil and other non-food items to supplement the public distribution system rations which are still virtually impossible to transfer after displaced iraqis have moved to a new neighborhood , though it is easier for shiites to do so , '' the report says . refugees international visited a sadrist office in baghdad 's ur district and observed residents providing `` clothing , milk , oil , rice , sugar , clothes and fuel for heating and cooking when supplies are available . '' the sadrists also adjudicate legal disputes among citizens and give stipends to families of displaced people and slain or jailed mehdi army fighters . the report says sunni militias also play a similar role in helping needy and displaced sunnis , though there is less organized help . `` sunni militias also handle the distribution of key items such as heating gas . as sunnis in baghdad get virtually no electricity or other services from the government , they rely on local militias and warlords to secure their areas and manage what services they can obtain . '' the displaced have joined `` awakening '' groups -- the `` u.s.-backed militias '' dominated by sunnis . those groups provide security duties , such as guarding checkpoints , and many of them have been getting paychecks from the united states . the u.n. refugee agency says the displacement crisis caused by the war in iraq is the most significant in the middle east since the population changes that occurred during the 1948 creation of israel . along with the 2.7 million internally displaced people , there are more than 2 million iraqi refugees -- mostly in syria and jordan . the report slams the government of iraq as being `` unwilling '' and `` unable '' to address such humanitarian issues -- `` lacking both the capacity and the political will to use its important resources to address humanitarian needs . '' `` the little assistance provided by the government is perceived by most as being biased in favor of the shiite population , especially when it comes to the delivery of government services such as electricity or food ration cards from the public distribution system , '' the report says . the report adds that the `` international community has largely been in denial '' about the dire humanitarian situation in iraq . `` only recently has the united nations issued a common humanitarian appeal for iraq , recognizing the nature of the situation and the need for all agencies to step up and address humanitarian needs .

413	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- presidential candidates have been wooing voters in iowa for months , but who wins thursday may simply come down to where the caucus-goers live , where they meet and the weather . iowa is a mixed bag politically , and one of the most evenly divided states in the nation . but the candidates will likely watch two regions more closely than others . the central part of the state -- including industrial des moines -- is iowa 's most democratic area . western iowa , on the other hand , is home to the most republicans -- especially the rural counties in the northwest . the mississippi river city of davenport is expected to be one of the most significant battlegrounds , with linn county -- dominated by the university town of cedar rapids -- also attracting lots of attention from both parties . past iowa caucuses have been nail-biters for the candidates . democrat al gore won the state by a margin of just 0.3 percent in 2000 , while president bush carried it in 2004 by 0.7 percent . in fact , bush was the first gop presidential candidate to carry iowa in 20 years . important endorsement . the support of iowa 's largest newspaper , the des moines register , may also play a role in thursday 's caucuses . the paper 's presidential endorsements began in 1988 and have become a highly sought-after prize in iowa presidential politics . george w. bush was the register 's pick in 2000 and went on to win iowa , the gop nomination and the white house . republican presidential hopeful bob dole won the state in 1996 and 1988 after receiving the paper 's support . democratic candidates have n't had as much success with the register 's endorsement . john edwards finished in second place in iowa in 2004 , while paul simon was also a close second in 1988 . the paper endorsed sen. john mccain and sen. hillary clinton for their respective parties ' nominations . the candidates have to appeal to voters with strong opinions . on the republican side , 37 percent of participants in the 2000 iowa gop caucuses identified themselves as members of the religious right and 73 percent described themselves as conservatives . meanwhile , 56 percent of the participants in iowa 's 2004 democratic caucuses described themselves as either very or somewhat liberal . about 37 percent said they were moderates . the weather . iowans who take part in the caucuses must traditionally brave freezing temperatures and lots of snow . presidential candidates know bad weather may affect how many people turn out , but 1972 was the only time rough winter conditions played a role in the caucuses , according to drake university 's hugh winebrenner -- the nation 's leading expert on iowa caucus history . caucus-goers that year encountered heavy snowdrifts from a blizzard the previous day . temperatures dipped below zero across most of the state . the weather forced about one-fourth of iowa 's 99 counties to postpone their democratic caucuses up to two days after the scheduled date . the forecast for thursday is much better . temperatures will be in the 20s during the day and dip just below that as the caucuses begin , according to the des moines register . e-mail to a friend .

424	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- heather mills presented `` less than candid '' testimony about her life with former beatle paul mccartney during her divorce case and made more money during their marriage than before , according to a ruling released tuesday . mccartney 's lawyer fiona shackleton , left , pictured after it is alleged mills threw water over her . mills represented herself during the proceedings and was a `` less than impressive witness '' on her own behalf , judge hugh bennett wrote in awarding her # 24.3 million -lrb- $ 48.6 million -rrb- -- far less than the # 125 million she had sought from mccartney in the dissolution of their four-year marriage . `` having given in her favor every allowance for the enormous strain she must have been under and in conducting her own case , i am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence , both written and oral , was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid , '' bennett wrote . mills emerged from the court monday angry about the judge 's treatment of her . she said the judge and attorneys acted like they were part of a `` club . '' blog : did mills pour water on mccartney 's lawyer ? a summary of bennett 's decision was released monday , but mills had sought to keep the full ruling under wraps . britain 's court of appeals ruled against her tuesday , and her lawyer , david rosen , said she accepted the decision . see a list of expensive celebrity divorces '' `` she as a mother has strived to protect her child and felt there were certain issues and matters in the judgment which affected that , '' rosen said . mills opposed the full ruling 's publication because it contained private details about her and her 4-year-old daughter with mccartney , beatrice . watch mills react to monday 's decision '' bennett had good things to say about mills in his judgment , commending her strength in the face of disability . mills lost her left leg below the knee in a 1993 traffic accident . but he discounted many of the arguments the former model made about her personal wealth before and after her 2002 marriage to mccartney . he ruled that mills earned far less before marriage than she claimed , and far more while married -- and at several points in his decision , he wrote that mills ' ideas about their marriage were `` make-belief . '' `` i find that , far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife 's career and charitable activities , he did the exact opposite , '' bennett wrote . mccartney , meanwhile , presented balanced evidence and was a consistent witness , he wrote . `` he expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation , if not anger , '' the judge wrote in a glimpse of the emotions aired behind closed doors . read the full ruling -lrb- . pdf file -- adobe acrobat required -rrb- . bennett found mills failed to produce financial records to back up statements about money she claimed to have in the bank before marriage , which she said amounted to more than # 2 million . in one instance , the judge pointed out mccartney 's company loaned mills money to buy a home in hove , england -- money that she would not have needed had she had such an amount in the bank . and bennett found that mills ' income actually improved during the marriage . in one year , she earned # 1 million -lrb- $ 2 million -rrb- from a single modeling contract , he wrote . and he quoted mills ' 2002 book , `` a single step , '' in which she wrote that her charity work and public speaking roles had expanded `` to such an extent that it has left little time for anything else . '' `` she is a kindly person and is devoted to her charitable causes , '' the judge wrote . `` she has conducted her own case before me with a steely , yet courteous , determination . '' the couple met in 1999 , a year after the death of mccartney 's wife of 30 years , linda . the judge said mccartney continued to grieve for his late wife well into his marriage with mills -- and he suggested mills misrepresented her case because she had been star-struck . `` the wife for her part must have felt rather swept off her feet by a man as famous as the husband , '' he wrote . `` i think this may well have warped her perception leading her to indulge in make-belief . the objective facts simply do not support her case . '' bennett discounted mills ' claims that she was anything more than a loving and devoted wife in helping mccartney . `` the wife 's evidence that in some way she was the husband 's ` psychologist , ' even allowing for hyperbole , is typical of her make-belief , '' the judge wrote . mills and mccartney failed to agree on a divorce settlement in six days of hearings in february , leaving the judge to decide the terms . bennett 's 58-page decision concluded that # 24.3 million was enough for mills to live comfortably and take care of their daughter 's needs . mccartney had proposed a # 15.8 million settlement . the judgment included # 35,000 a year for beatrice , # 600,000 for mills and # 2.5 million for her to purchase property in london . e-mail to a friend .

'' `` it was my understanding that western precision was paying roughly $ 50,000 a week into the coffers of the church , '' former sect member richard holm said . `` it would have been close to $ 200,000 a month . '' holm said he helped build western precision . a court affidavit signed by a man whose father was the president of western precision makes similar allegations . `` during 2003 , the amount being sent to the storehouse and the flds was around $ 100,000 per month , '' john nielsen said in the october 26 , 2005 , affidavit . `` i have personal knowledge that checks sent to the flds church/warren jeffs by -lsb- western precision -rsb- are payable to the flds church and/or warren jeffs .

'' he added , `` however , dod is not aware of any criminal allegations against anyone managing the companies in question . '' bob maginnis , a retired army lieutenant colonel who now works with a contractor for the pentagon , said the department does background checks before signing contracts . `` the dod is obviously abiding by the law , and if we want them to look deeper and discriminate on religious or other activities we need to tell them . '' but he added , `` if there was a direct line between jeffs and this company , and his name was associated with a contract , then that should have come to attention of those that were bidding contract . '' it 's unclear whether jeffs ' name was on any contract , but other senior members of his church were managing the companies . what might taxpayers think of it all ? `` they 're just going to shake their head and say here 's another example of our tax money going down the drain to support this polygamist in texas who abuses children and women , '' maginnis said . `` they 'll be appalled and rightly so .

'' in his cnn interview , dujana was quick with messages of hate , calling all westerners legitimate targets because of the actions of leaders like u.s. president george w. bush and then-british prime minister tony blair , who he says are not giving muslims the chance to be in power . dujana studied in pakistan and fought in afghanistan from 1988 to 1991 . he told cnn that he met al qaeda leader osama bin laden in afghanistan during the fight against soviet occupation . at the time , bin laden was a field commander and he was an ordinary soldier , he said . dujana said bin laden was well respected then and helped him and others realize that it was permissible to kill people to defend islam . `` i did n't read it in the quran , '' he said . '' it 's based on the teachings of our teachers , clerics , especially what osama bin laden first said . '' `` because of america 's arrogance , many in the muslim world know , believe , it 's permissible to kill american soldiers . it 's halal ; it 's permitted , '' he said . the court declared jemaah islamiyah a terrorist organization monday and ordered it to pay 10 million rupiah -lrb- $ 1,088 -rrb- . around the same time dujana was captured last june , authorities also apprehended jemaah islamiyah 's leader , known simply as zarkasih . a verdict on his case is expected soon . last week , two other top jemaah islamiyah leaders -- dr. agus purwanto and abdur rohim -- were brought to indonesia following their arrest in malaysia . both are being investigated for their possible role in fomenting violence in poso . terrorism expert sidney jones says abdur rohim is believed to have replaced zarkasih as jemaah islamiyah leader . `` it is another major blow to jemaah islamiyah , but difficult to tell what the impact will be , '' jones told cnn via e-mail last week . `` it could embolden a more militant faction . -lsb- it -rsb- could also lead to some serious reassessment within the organization about its future .

431	-lrb- this old house -rrb- -- unless you 're a perfect caretaker of your lawn -lrb- and , really , who is ? -rrb- , prepare for another round in the turf wars this summer . you 'll have to deal with a full frontal assault from the dandelions , of course . and an attack from the crabgrass . but you 'll face more stealthy opponents , too : root-chomping grubs and microscopic mildew that turn the grass from green to gray or brown . `` if a lawn is neglected , or cared for in a hit-or-miss way , it gets weak , '' says this old house landscape contractor roger cook . `` and that 's when weeds , insects , or fungal diseases become a major problem . '' little wonder that last year almost 50 million homeowners bought products to fight these invaders . but as in most battles , the best defense is a strong offense : doing everything right to cultivate healthy turf . that means giving it up to an inch and a half of water per week ; aerating and dethatching annually so water and nutrients can get down to the roots ; mowing with a sharp blade to the right height -lrb- ask your local garden center what 's best where you live -rrb- ; and fertilizing in spring and fall . so promise yourself -- and your turf -- you 'll do that this year . in the meantime , here 's how to conquer the most common turf problems you 're likely to confront this summer . fungal disease . symptoms : circular patches of yellow-to-brown grass ; or blades with tiny red threads . culprits : powdery mildew , brown patch , dollar spot , and fusarium patch ; or red thread . these fungal diseases can take hold of stressed turf . solutions : though lawns will generally recover from small areas of infection , if a fungus is progressively marching across your yard , look for a fungicide with the active ingredient thiophanate-methyl and follow the directions . for an organic fix , search out a corn-gluten mix that will cure brown patch and weaken most other fungi . then nurse your lawn back to health by practicing good lawn-care habits : avoid excessive shade -lrb- prune back trees and large shrubs , if necessary -rrb- and too many applications of fertilizer , herbicides , or pesticides . carefully monitor your turf 's moisture intake and never water in the evening . weeds . symptoms : fast-growing and unruly greenery that quickly overtakes surrounding grass . this old house : what type of grass is right for your yard . culprits : crabgrass or broadleaf weeds such as dandelion , purslane , henbit , and chickweed that commonly pop up where soil is compacted and grass has n't completely taken root . to check for compacted soil , stick a screwdriver into the ground ;

432	ip-455 press release 8 february 2008 the findings of a scotland yard inquiry into how mohtarma benazir bhutto died after being attacked during a political rally in rawalpindi were presented to the government of pakistan today . the bomb explodes near bhutto 's vehicle following a political rally in rawalpindi . the conclusions of the inquiry were outlined in a detailed report handed over to interim interior minister hamid nawaz by detective superintendent john macbrayne , accompanied by a senior official from the british high commission , during a meeting in islamabad . the text of the executive summary of the report is as follows : . on the 27th december 2007 , mohtarma benazir bhutto , the leader of the pakistan people 's party -lrb- ppp -rrb- , died as a result of being attacked in rawalpindi , pakistan . following discussions between the prime minister and president musharraf , it was agreed that officers from the metropolitan police counter terrorism command -lrb- so15 -rrb- should support the investigation into ms bhutto 's death . the primary focus of the scotland yard team was to assist the pakistani authorities in establishing the cause and circumstances of ms bhutto 's death . the wider investigation to establish culpability has remained entirely a matter for the pakistani authorities . the so15 team was led by a detective superintendent senior investigating officer , and comprised two forensic experts , an expert in analysing and assessing video media and an experienced investigating officer . the team arrived in pakistan on 4th january 2008 and spent two and a half weeks conducting extensive enquiries . during the course of their work , the team were joined by other specialists from the united kingdom . the uk team were given extensive support and co-operation by the pakistani authorities , ms bhutto 's family , and senior officials from ms bhutto 's party . the task of establishing exactly what happened was complicated by the lack of an extended and detailed search of the crime scene , the absence of an autopsy , and the absence of recognised body recovery and victim identification processes . nevertheless , the evidence that is available is sufficient for reliable conclusions to be drawn . within the overall objective , a particular focus has been placed on establishing the actual cause of death , and whether there were one or more attackers in the immediate vicinity of ms bhutto . the cause of death . considerable reliance has been placed upon the x-rays taken at rawalpindi general hospital following ms bhutto 's death . given their importance , the x-rays have been independently verified as being of ms bhutto by comparison with her dental x-rays . additionally , a valuable insight was gained from the accounts given by the medical staff involved in her treatment , and from those members of ms bhutto 's family who washed her body before burial . ms bhutto 's only apparent injury was a major trauma to the right side of the head . the uk experts all exclude this injury being an entry or exit wound as a result of gunshot . the only x-ray records , taken after her death , were of ms bhutto 's head . however , the possibility of a bullet wound to her mid or lower trunk can reasonably be excluded . this is based upon the protection afforded by the armoured vehicle in which she was travelling at the time of the attack , and the accounts of her family and hospital staff who examined her . the limited x-ray material , the absence of a full post mortem examination and ct scan , have meant that the uk home office pathologist , dr nathaniel cary , who has been consulted in this case , is unable categorically to exclude the possibility of there being a gunshot wound to the upper trunk or neck . however when his findings are put alongside the accounts of those who had close contact with ms bhutto 's body , the available evidence suggests that there was no gunshot injury . importantly , dr cary excludes the possibility of a bullet to the neck or upper trunk as being a relevant factor in the actual cause of death , when set against the nature and extent of her head injury . in his report dr cary states : . • `` the only tenable cause for the rapidly fatal head injury in this case is that it occurred as the result of impact due to the effects of the bomb-blast . '' • `` in my opinion mohtarma benazir bhutto died as a result of a severe head injury sustained as a consequence of the bomb-blast and due to head impact somewhere in the escape hatch of the vehicle . '' given the severity of the injury to ms bhutto 's head , the prospect that she inadvertently hit her head whilst ducking down into the vehicle can be excluded as a reasonable possibility . high explosives of the type typically used in this sort of device , detonate at a velocity between 6000 and 9000 metres per second . this means that when considering the explosive quantities and distances involved , such an explosion would generate significantly more force than would be necessary to provoke the consequences as occurred in this case . it is also important to comment upon the construction of the vehicle . it was fitted with b6 grade armour and designed to withstand gunfire and bomb-blast . it is an unfortunate and misleading aspect of this case that the roof escape hatch has frequently been referred to as a sunroof . it is not . it is designed and intended to be used solely as a means of escape . it has a solid lip with a depth of 9cm . ms bhutto 's injury is entirely consistent with her head impacting upon the lip of the escape hatch . detailed analysis of the media footage provides supporting evidence . ms bhutto 's head did not completely disappear from view until 0.6 seconds before the blast . she can be seen moving forward and to the right as she ducked down into the vehicle . whilst her exact head position at the time of the detonation can never be ascertained , the overwhelming conclusion must be that she did not succeed in getting her head entirely below the lip of the escape hatch when the explosion occurred . how many people were involved in the immediate attack ? there has been speculation that two individuals were directly involved in the attack . the suggestion has been that one suspect fired shots , and a second detonated the bomb . all the available evidence points toward the person who fired shots and the person who detonated the explosives being one and the same person . • body parts from only one individual remain unidentified . expert opinion provides strong evidence that they originate from the suicide bomber . • analysis of the media footage places the gunman at the rear of the vehicle and looking down immediately before the explosion . the footage does not show the presence of any other potential bomber . • this footage when considered alongside the findings of the forensic explosive expert , that the bombing suspect was within 1 to 2 metres of the vehicle towards it rear and with no person or other obstruction between him and the vehicle , strongly suggests that the bomber and gunman were at the same position . it is virtually inconceivable that anyone who was where the gunman can clearly be seen on the media footage , could have survived the blast and escaped . the inevitable conclusion is that there was one attacker in the immediate vicinity of the vehicle in which ms bhutto was travelling . in essence , all the evidence indicates that one suspect has fired the shots before detonating an improvised explosive device . at the time of the attack this person was standing close to the rear of ms bhutto 's vehicle . the blast caused a violent collision between her head and the escape hatch area of the vehicle , causing a severe and fatal head injury . john macbrayne qpm detective superintendent counter terrorism command 1st february 2008 e-mail to a friend .

435	tokyo , japan -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.s. military in japan has charged a marine with rape and other violations of the uniform code of military justice in the alleged sexual assault of 14-year old girl in okinawa . a civic group member protests against hadnott near the u.s. embassy in tokyo on february 13 . staff sgt. tyrone luther hadnott , 38 , has been charged with the rape of a child under 16 , abusive sexual contact with a child , making a false official statement , adultery and kidnapping , the marines said friday . no dates for the court-martial have been set . in february , japanese authorities released hadnott after the girl dropped the allegations against him , but the marine corps conducted its own investigation to see if hadnott violated codes of military justice . it held him at a marine facility . the rape accusation against hadnott stirred memories of a brutal rape more than a decade ago and triggered outrage across japan . prime minister yasuo fukuda deplored as `` unforgivable '' the allegations against hadnott . the incident also led to tight restrictions , for a time , for american troops and their families at the u.s. base on okinawa . the u.s. military in japan also formed a sexual assault prevention task force after the incident . more than 40,000 u.s. troops are stationed in japan , most of them on okinawa . the troops were placed there under a security alliance after japan was defeated in world war ii and was renounced its right to a military . the u.s. military presence has at times bred resentment among some japanese , who have long complained about crime , noise and accidents . anti-american sentiments boiled over in 1995 after three american servicemen kidnapped and gang-raped a 12-year-old okinawan schoolgirl . two years ago , a u.s. civilian military employee was jailed for nine years for raping two women . e-mail to a friend .
436	berlin . germany -- germany striker kevin kuranyi fired schalke up to joint second in the bundesliga , while bayern munich have a golden chance to put one hand on the league title if they beat stuttgart on sunday . kuranyi 's early goal was enough to give schalke a vital victory over champions league rivals hamburg . kuranyi 's 15th league goal of the season -- after just two minutes -- gave schalke the three points with a 1-0 win in hamburg to go level on 54 points with werder bremen , who shared a thrilling 3-3 draw at karlsruhe . after schalke sacked coach mirko slomka a fortnight ago , caretaker coach mike bueskens was delighted with the victory over their rivals . `` i am very , very pleased with the win , '' he said . `` we beat a direct competitor for a champions league place and the early goal worked very well for us . hamburg played well , but they did n't take their chances . '' schalke and bremen , who remain second on goal difference , are now nine points behind bayern with four games left . a bayern win will send them 12-points clear with a vastly superior goal difference and only a mathematical miracle would prevent them being crowned german champions for the 21st time . but bayern are without internationals miroslav klose and philipp lahm against stuttgart , while oliver kahn is a huge injury doubt for the clash against stuttgart who welcome back mario gomez back from injury . the draw in karlsruhe was a blow to bremen , who were shocked by an early goal when home striker sebastian freis drilled home his 15th minute shot . werder hit back when midfielder diego equalised eight minutes later and former schalke midfielder mesut oezil scored his first goal of the season to put bremen 2-1 ahead on 29 minutes . but freis added his second on 59 minutes before kapllani put karlsruhe ahead only for bremen striker boubacar sanogo to level the scores in the 86th minute . `` it was a very entertaining game and the fans got their money 's worth , '' said bremen coach thomas schaaf . `` but we ca n't be happy with the result , because it was possible for us to keep the pressure on .

439	kampala , uganda -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a fight between ugandan and libyan presidential guards sparked chaos during a ceremony attended by the heads of state from 11 african nations on wednesday . libyan leader moammar gadhafi and ugandan president yoweri museveni attend the opening of the mosque . several of the guards to the visiting heads of state from kenya , tanzania , burundi , rwanda , mali , somalia , sudan and djibouti sustained serious injuries in the fight , which included punches , kicks and the drawing of guns . no leaders were hurt in the melee , though several were knocked over . several journalists also were caught up in the fracas and suffered injuries or lost their grips on cameras and recorders . the incident occurred at the opening of a massive gadhafi national mosque in kampala , a structure begun by the late ugandan dictator idi amin in 1972 and completed with financing from libya , according to african media reports . minutes after libyan leader moammar gadhafi and his host , ugandan president yoweri museveni , jointly unveiled a plaque to mark the event , the libyan guards pushed away the guards of other delegations at the mosque 's entrance . the ugandan guards -- who had traded hostilities with the predominantly-arab libyan guards at every joint event since gadhafi 's arrival in the country sunday -- reacted with fury and fought back . museveni briefly lost his balance when a hefty libyan guard pushed him to a wall . another libyan guard pushed rwandan president paul kagame , who also lost his balance but was caught by his own guards . the vice president of tanzania was knocked over by fighting guards as he was taking his shoes off to enter the mosque . guards to the rest of the visiting presidents and prime ministers kept their respective leaders out of the fray , with some drawing their guns as the dignitaries looked on in disbelief . some leaders -- notably those from somalia , burundi and djibouti -- were visibly uneasy as guns were drawn on all sides . by the time the fight was over more than six minutes later , about a dozen presidential guards were left bleeding from compound fractures and the libyan and ugandan protocol officials traded bitter accusations of disrespect and racism . `` what are your people up to ? do you want to kill our leader ? '' a libyan protocol official said to his ugandan counterpart . the ugandan official , who declined to be named , shouted back , `` why do think you 're superior ? what makes you think uganda has any ill intention against gadhafi ? '' the ugandan official said museveni 's guards were simply doing their job as security for the host country and had a right to respond when the libyan guards pushed them back . it has taken 36 years to complete the giant mosque on a hill in the heart of kampala . it used to be a colonial fort named after british capt. frederick lugard . the mosque can accommodate as many as 17,000 people at one time , according to the engineers , who call it the largest mosque in sub-saharan africa . many muslims interviewed said the mosque 's opening evoked sweet memories of amin , the deceased dictator . `` it is a great day and thanks be to allah for the completion , '' said salim abdul noor , 39 . `` this should remind us that while amin is demonized as africa 's worst dictator , there are many things he did for this country that successive governments largely depend on , and much of the completed installations and structures like this beautiful mosque was amin 's dream , may allah rest him in peace . '' the swedish vice president of the european islamic conference , adly abu hajar , 57 , said the mosque heals rifts in a religion introduced to uganda in 1844 by arab slave traders . `` i find this complex has brought unity among muslims in uganda . there have been so many factions , but this attraction has brought them together , identifying themselves with a common home . '' the fight prompted a crisis meeting by ugandan security authorities , after which invited diplomats from mainly the european missions in uganda expressed dismay . `` it 's disgrace . it shows there is something wrong yet unknown between the two parties , '' said the head of one european mission in kampala , who declined to be named . the police chief , maj. gen. kale kayihura , and the head of the army , gen. aronda nyakairima , declined to comment on the fight . but capt. edison kwesiga , the spokesman of the ugandan presidential guard brigade , confirmed their hostile relationship with the libyans . `` it is our responsibility to ensure the safety of any visiting head of state . we have to do our job using any means . but our libyan brothers always want us to fail . true , it 's not the first time they come and act as you see , '' kwesiga said . e-mail to a friend .

441	baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- four u.s. soldiers died in a roadside bombing in iraq on sunday , military officials reported , bringing the american toll in the 5-year-old war to the grim milestone of 4,000 deaths . troops emerge from a bunker after receiving the `` all clear '' sunday following a truck bombing in mosul . the four were killed when their vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device while patrolling a neighborhood in southern baghdad , the u.s. military headquarters in iraq reported sunday night . a fifth soldier was wounded in the attack , which took place about 10 p.m. -lrb- 3 p.m. et -rrb- . the u.s. milestone comes just days after americans marked the fifth anniversary of the start of the war . `` no casualty is more or less significant than another ; each soldier , marine , airman and sailor is equally precious and their loss equally tragic , '' rear admiral gregory smith , the u.s. military 's chief spokesman in iraq , said . `` every single loss of a soldier , sailor , airman or marine is keenly felt by military commanders , families and friends both in theatre and at home , '' smith said . of the 4,000 u.s. military personnel killed in the war , 3,263 have been killed in attacks and fighting and 737 in non-hostile incidents , such as traffic accidents and suicides . eight of the 4,000 killed were civilians working for the pentagon . many of those killed over the years , like the four soldiers slain on sunday in baghdad , have been targeted by improvised explosive devices -- the roadside bombs that have been described as the weapon of choice for insurgents and a weapon that has come to symbolize iraq 's tenacious insurgency . the existence of the pentagon 's joint improvised explosive device defeat organization has been developed to counter the threat of ieds in iraq as well as afghanistan . the group calls ieds the `` weapon of choice for adaptive and resilient networks of insurgents and terrorists . '' watch how ieds have become deadly staple in iraq war '' meanwhile , estimates of the iraqi death toll range from about 80,000 to the hundreds of thousands , with another 2 million forced to leave the country and 2.5 million people displaced within iraq , according to the u.n. high commissioner for refugees . president bush ordered u.s. troops into iraq on march 19 , 2003 , after months of warnings that then-iraqi leader saddam hussein was concealing stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and efforts to build a nuclear bomb . u.n. weapons inspectors found no sign of banned weapons before the invasion , and the cia later concluded that iraq had dismantled its weapons programs in the 1990s . hussein 's government fell in early april 2003 , and iraq 's new government executed him in december 2006 . the news of the 4,000 mark came on the same day that iraq 's national security adviser urged americans to be patient with the progress of the war , contending that it is `` well worth fighting '' because it has implications about `` global terror . '' `` this is global terrorism hitting everywhere , and they have chosen iraq to be a battlefield . and we have to take them on , '' mowaffak al-rubaie said sunday on cnn 's `` late edition with wolf blitzer . '' `` if we do n't prevail , if we do n't succeed in this war , then we are doomed forever , '' he said . `` i understand and sympathize with the mothers , with the widows , with the children who have lost their beloved ones in this country . `` but honestly , it is well worth fighting and well worth investing the money and the treasure and the sweat and the tears in iraq . '' nearly 160,000 u.s. troops remain in iraq , and the war has cost u.s. taxpayers about $ 600 billion , according to the house budget committee . the conflict is now widely unpopular among americans : a cnn-opinion research corp. poll out wednesday found only 32 percent of americans support the conflict . and 61 percent said they want the next president to remove most u.s. troops within a few months of taking office . in the weekly democratic radio address saturday , sen. bob menendez of new jersey said president bush `` took us to war on the wings of a lie . '' menendez said that the war has depleted the resources and morale of the u.s. military ; diverted national attention away from the war in afghanistan , where al qaeda is regrouping ; and hurt the hunt for osama bin laden . the iraq war has not made americans safer , menendez said , but has instead hurt the u.s. economy . the senator called for a `` responsible new direction '' regarding iraq . cnn learned last week , from several u.s. military officials familiar with the recommendations but not authorized to speak on the record , that senior u.s. military officials are preparing to recommend to bush a four - to six-week `` pause '' in additional troop withdrawals from iraq after the last of the `` surge '' brigades leaves in july . `` if the conditions on the ground dictate that we have to have a pause , then we will have to have a pause , '' al-rubaie said . the return of all five brigades added to the iraq contingent last year could reduce troop levels by up to 30,000 , but still leave approximately 130,000 or more troops in iraq . al-rubaie emphasized sunday that any drawdown of u.s. troops `` has to be based on the conditions on the ground . '' `` it depends on the development and the growth and the equipment and the capabilities of the iraqi security forces , and the preparedness of the iraqi security forces , '' he said . `` this should not be a purely political decision . it should be also a technical , military and intelligence decision . '' but there has been too much `` foot-dragging on key governance questions in iraq , '' democratic sen. ron wyden of oregon said on cnn on sunday . `` it seems to me you put off those troop withdrawals , you send exactly the wrong message to the iraqis . '' on wednesday , bush will visit the pentagon to be briefed by the joint chiefs of staff , chaired by adm. michael mullen . the american troop level in iraq `` depends on the negotiations that we are engaged in now between the government of iraq and the united states government , '' al-rubaie said . when conditions warrant the withdrawal of american troops , the iraqis will say '' ` thank you very much , indeed , ' '' al-rubaie said . `` a big , big thank you for the united states of america for liberating iraq , for helping us in sustaining the security gains in iraq ... and we will give them a very , very good farewell party then . '' responding to recent remarks from u.s. presidential candidates that iraqis are not taking responsibility for their own future , al-rubaie said iraqis are making political and security gains . `` literally by the day and by the week , we are gradually assuming more responsibility , '' he said , noting that iraqis have taken responsibility for security in many provinces . other developments : . • u.s. troops raided a suspected suicide bomber cell in diyala province on sunday , killing a dozen militants , half of whom had shaved their bodies -- which the u.s. military says indicates they were in the final stage of preparation for a suicide attack . diyala province stretches north and east of baghdad and has been a major front for u.s. troops fighting militants . • several mortars landed in baghdad 's international zone on sunday , according to the interior ministry . a u.s. embassy spokeswoman said there were no major casualties . watch smoke rise from the green zone '' • a suicide car bomb exploded at a fuel station sunday in a predominantly shiite neighborhood in northwest baghdad , killing seven people and wounding 12 others , the interior ministry said . • a suicide bomber detonated a truck full of explosives outside the main gate of an iraqi military base in mosul , killing at least 10 iraqi soldiers and wounding 35 people , including 20 soldiers , mosul police said . the u.s. military put the death toll higher , at 12 . • a mortar round landed in a shiite neighborhood in eastern baghdad , killing seven people and injuring nine others , a ministry official said . six more mortar rounds landed in other baghdad neighborhoods sunday night , killing three people , the interior ministry said . • in southeastern baghdad , gunmen riding in at least two cars opened fire on a crowded outdoor market , killing at least three people and wounding 17 others , the interior ministry said . • a suicide bomber detonated a small truck rigged with explosives outside a local awakening council leader 's house just east of samarra on saturday , killing at least five people and wounding 13 others , a samarra police official said . awakening councils are largely sunni security groups that have been recruited by the u.s. military . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's mohammed tawfeeq contributed to this report .
442	-lrb- this old house -rrb- -- unless you 're a perfect caretaker of your lawn -lrb- and , really , who is ? -rrb- , prepare for another round in the turf wars this summer . you 'll have to deal with a full frontal assault from the dandelions , of course . and an attack from the crabgrass . but you 'll face more stealthy opponents , too : root-chomping grubs and microscopic mildew that turn the grass from green to gray or brown . `` if a lawn is neglected , or cared for in a hit-or-miss way , it gets weak , '' says this old house landscape contractor roger cook . `` and that 's when weeds , insects , or fungal diseases become a major problem . '' little wonder that last year almost 50 million homeowners bought products to fight these invaders . but as in most battles , the best defense is a strong offense : doing everything right to cultivate healthy turf . that means giving it up to an inch and a half of water per week ; aerating and dethatching annually so water and nutrients can get down to the roots ; mowing with a sharp blade to the right height -lrb- ask your local garden center what 's best where you live -rrb- ; and fertilizing in spring and fall . so promise yourself -- and your turf -- you 'll do that this year . in the meantime , here 's how to conquer the most common turf problems you 're likely to confront this summer . fungal disease . symptoms : circular patches of yellow-to-brown grass ; or blades with tiny red threads . culprits : powdery mildew , brown patch , dollar spot , and fusarium patch ; or red thread . these fungal diseases can take hold of stressed turf . solutions : though lawns will generally recover from small areas of infection , if a fungus is progressively marching across your yard , look for a fungicide with the active ingredient thiophanate-methyl and follow the directions . for an organic fix , search out a corn-gluten mix that will cure brown patch and weaken most other fungi . then nurse your lawn back to health by practicing good lawn-care habits : avoid excessive shade -lrb- prune back trees and large shrubs , if necessary -rrb- and too many applications of fertilizer , herbicides , or pesticides . carefully monitor your turf 's moisture intake and never water in the evening . weeds . symptoms : fast-growing and unruly greenery that quickly overtakes surrounding grass . this old house : what type of grass is right for your yard . culprits : crabgrass or broadleaf weeds such as dandelion , purslane , henbit , and chickweed that commonly pop up where soil is compacted and grass has n't completely taken root . to check for compacted soil , stick a screwdriver into the ground ; it should slide in easily . solutions : the first step is to eradicate any foreign invaders . the best approach is to pull them out by hand using a weeder or a hoe . this will also loosen the soil in affected areas . or use a liquid herbicide in a hand sprayer to spot-treat an infestation . if weeds are too plentiful to be pulled , check your garden center for a `` weed-and-feed '' blend of granular fertilizer and herbicide that will kill weeds without harming turf types commonly grown in your area , or look for an organic fertilizer with corn gluten . be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly , as some formulas must be applied during a dry spell or need a 24-hour breather with no foot traffic . from here on out , mow up to twice a week during the beginning of summer when grass grows swiftly , and raise the mower blade an inch during hot or dry periods . water well as the summer heats up , and your turf should naturally overtake the weeds . in the fall , open up compacted soil poke holes with a pitchfork over a small yard , or rent a power aerator for large yards and overseed the lawn . you may want to follow up with a pre-emergent herbicide next spring . insects . symptoms : brown turf that becomes loose enough to lift like a mat . culprits : white grubs , a catch-all name for root-chomping beetle larvae , including june bugs , japanese beetles , and masked chafers . to be sure that 's what you 've got , cut a square foot of infected turf and roll it back , looking for pale , half-inch - to inch-long c-shaped bugs . if you find more than six , treat the turf . this old house : meet the good bugs . solutions : grubs are the biggest threat to lawns , and pesticides formulated with imidacloprid are proven effective . for an organic fix , spread powdered milky spore or lay down beneficial nematodes-microscopic worms that will feed on the grubs if they 're present . with nematodes , timing the application with their life cycle is critical , so be sure to follow the directions on the box exactly . both milky spore and nematodes can be ordered from some garden centers or online -lrb- gardensalive.com -rrb- . symptoms : irregular-shaped patches of brownish-yellow grass . culprits : chinch bugs , gray-black , quarter-inch-long insects that suck moisture from grass and are most likely to attack st. augustine and zoysia grasses in the south and kentucky bluegrass in the north . to spot them , bury an empty coffee can , with both ends removed , at the edge of the affected area and fill it with water . the bugs will seek out the moisture , then float to the top . if you see more than 10 after 20 minutes , you should address the problem . solutions : chinch bugs live on the surface , among thatch , so dethatching will reduce their numbers . to eradicate them completely , look for an appropriate insecticide with a pyrethroid ingredient . longer-term , overseed with chinch-bug-resistant grasses . symptoms : patches of thin lawn with blades chewed off at the base . culprits : sod webworms and tropical sod webworms , hairless cream-to-gray spotted caterpillars that grow into small , buff-colored moths at maturity . the tropical species that thrive in warm southern climates cause the most harm . to check for webworms , mix two tablespoons of mild detergent with two gallons of water ; pour it over the infested turf . any larvae will float to the top . solutions : you can try flooding your lawn to drown them . or choose an appropriate insecticide ; in an organic product , look for the ingredients azadirachtin or spinosad . with extreme cases of tropical webworm infestation you may need to replace the turf with a resistant grass mix . tip : if dogs regularly make a pit stop of your lawn , keep a hose or water bucket nearby . dog urine is high in nitrogen , which can `` burn '' turf , creating a good-sized yellow patch . the best fix is immediate action : flush the area asap with water to dilute it . once badly burned , grass wo n't come back on its own-you 'll have to rake out the dead stuff and reseed . this old house : what to do when your yard is bowser 's bathroom e-mail to a friend . get 2 free trial issues . copyright © 2008 this old house ventures , inc. .
443	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- for two weeks in 1976 , nadia comaneci was probably the most recognizable person on the planet . comaneci scored seven perfect 10s in montreal in 1976 . just 14-years-old and standing less than five feet tall , the elfin romanian was the undisputed star of that year 's games in montreal after becoming the first gymnast in history to score a perfect 10 . comaneci finished up with three gold medals and -- just to prove that her initial effort had been no fluke -- seven perfect scores . her initial performance on the uneven parallel bars was greeted with uproar as the three-digit scoreboard , struggling to cope with what had been considered an unachievable feat , flashed up 1.00 . comaneci finished with four perfect 10s and the gold medal on the bars , but it was on the balance beam , one of gymnastics ' most dangerous disciplines , that comaneci truly dazzled . seemingly fearless , comaneci pirouetted and back-flipped her way to two more perfect 10s and her second gold . her final perfect score came in the floor routine as she also collected first place in the overall competition . comaneci 's transformation into an international celebrity -- she appeared on the front covers of time , newsweek and sports illustrated in the same week -- had been as unexpected as it was sudden . yet comaneci had been working towards the olympics ever since she had been picked out as a gymnast of rare talents as a six-year-old growing up in the industrial town of onesti . the reality of life as an olympic champion at home in nicolae ceausescu 's romania however , was not easy . constant surveillance comaneci was honored as a hero of socialist labor on her return home , yet the regime -- terrified that comaneci would defect after enjoying her taste of western celebrity -- kept its greatest star under constant surveillance . four years later , a very different comaneci returned to olympic competition in moscow . as an 18-year-old , she was four inches taller , 20 pounds heavier and suffering from sciatica -- a teenage starlet already starting to fade . still , comaneci was able to retain her gold medal on the balance beam , and collected another one in the floor exercises . but she was also involved in one of the bitterest incidents of the games when she was controversially beaten in the all-round competition by the soviet gymnast yelena davydova . it took the judges 28 minutes to decide the result and , ultimately , it was a lower score from the soviet judge -- perhaps reflecting the worsening relations between the soviet union and its formerly loyal satellite -- that denied comaneci her second straight gold in the event . comaneci retired in 1984 , traveling to los angeles that year as a team coach , yet she found it difficult to adjust to a life out of the spotlight . in 1989 , a few weeks before the collapse of the ceausescu regime , she defected to the united states , finally settling in norman , oklahoma to run a gymnastics school after marrying u.s. gymnastics star bart conner in 1996 . in 2000 comaneci was named as one of the athletes of the century by the laureus world sports academy . e-mail to a friend .
444	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- who would win in a fight : a police-killing , rampage-driven thug or a superhero encased in a technologically superior suit of armor ? `` grand theft auto iv , '' released tuesday , could give `` iron man '' a run for its money this weekend . the answer could come this weekend when video game enthusiasts find out whether `` grand theft auto iv , '' expected to set sales records in the gaming world this week , will steal glory and revenue from a different entertainment empire : the movies . as the hype for `` gta iv '' continues to grow and reviews scream perfection , some speculate that the game will put a dent in marvel studios ' opening weekend box office for `` iron man . '' `` gta iv '' is the ninth incarnation of a video game in which the user acts as a criminal roaming a city . the series has faced criticism for being too violent , because users are allowed to beat , stab , shoot and kill citizens and police officers . `` iron man '' is a movie based on the marvel comic book superhero who creates an impressive suit of armor to save his life and help save the world . `` gta iv '' was released tuesday at midnight and is expected to gross about $ 400 million in the first week . see what makes this violent game so popular '' edward woo , a research analyst specializing in media and interactive entertainment at wedbush morgan securities , said the game 's release date and widespread reach could negatively affect opening box office numbers for `` iron man . '' `` people on friday or saturday might find themselves at home playing this game instead of at the cineplex , '' woo said . '' ` iron man ' will still have a pretty good release , but intuitively , i think it 's got be impacted when both share a similar audience and genre . '' because of the time element the game requires of its faithful -- between 30 and 40 hours to finish depending on skill level -- the question is whether gamers will put down their controllers for a couple of hours and go for a change of scenery . paramount vice chairman rob moore said he is n't worried . `` it 's crazy to think that young males ca n't carve out two hours for ` iron man , ' '' he told ew.com . `` it 's going to be a great week to be a young guy . '' watch why violence in the game concerns some people '' this weekend wo n't be the first time analysts have speculated about video games damaging box office numbers . last year , with $ 170 million in launch day sales and $ 300 million in its first week , `` halo 3 '' was blamed by some for the poor box office performance of `` the heartbreak kid , '' starring ben stiller . take-two interactive , the parent company of `` gta iv '' publisher rockstar games , predicted that with 6 million preorders worldwide , the game will bring in more than $ 400 million . `` gta iv '' has a chance of surpassing the movie `` pirates of the caribbean : at world 's end '' as the highest-grossing entertainment title in its first week of sales , and that 's across all genres . electronic arts ceo john riccitiello told the financial times this month that movie executives told him , '' ` iron man ' the movie is going to get killed by ` grand theft auto , ' the game . `` i do n't think i 've ever heard of that before , '' he said . the video game market is growing at a rate of 20 to 30 percent this year , but the movie industry is n't seeing as much of an increase , woo said . overall , video game sales as a whole have eclipsed box office sales , he said , but the movie industry catches up when it comes to dvds . ebullient reviews touted the game as `` the godfather '' of video games because of its cult-like following . andrew reiner , who reviewed `` gta iv '' for game informer , a well-known destination for all things gaming , scored it as a 10.0 / 10.0 under the title of `` perfection . '' `` i now know how film critics felt after screening ` the godfather , ' '' his review began . `` gta iv '' is a `` landscape-changing event that does n't come around very often , '' reiner said . it seems the feelings have translated to the regular consumer too . gamers from norway to britain to america echoed similar sentiments on gaming message boards . d.j. brotherson from winnipeg , canada , said he enjoyed the game so much , he wanted to skip work and keep playing all night , saying it was unlike any game he had ever played . `` the story line is very well-written , '' he said , adding that the game `` plays like an interactive martin scorsese movie .

'' watch how a hoax may be behind the ranch mystery '' calls were made to a texas family shelter march 29 and 30 from a female identifying herself as sarah barlow , the affidavit says . the caller said she was 16 , had a baby about 8 months old and was pregnant again . she said that her 49-year-old husband was physically and sexually abusive toward her and that they were living at the yfz ranch . the phone calls were made from a prepaid cell phone with no available records , according to the affidavit . however , it has been used in other cases linked to swinton , the document says . although texas officials said they have not found the woman who made the calls , they said they have found evidence that girls as young at 13 are forced into marriages with older men at the ranch . the flds has denied that any abuse takes place at the ranch . the woman identifying herself as sarah barlow also called a battered women 's shelter in snohomish county , washington , using another phone number , the affidavit says . that phone number was traced to swinton 's address , the affidavit says . on april 10 , the woman called the washington shelter again and was put on the line with a texas deputy . she said she felt that she would be punished for the trouble she had caused , was worried that her baby might be taken away and was angry with a woman she had contacted march 29 for prompting the raid by law enforcement . during that conversation , the affidavit says , the woman used terminology common to the flds , referring to her `` sister wives , '' for instance . the phone number used in the washington call was traced to the colorado springs apartment where swinton lives , the affidavit says . the number was also used to call a utah organization for women escaping polygamy and an abuse counseling center in fort myers , florida , phone records showed . swinton pleaded guilty to a charge of false reporting in june 2007 and was under a 12-month deferred sentence , the affidavit says . at a custody hearing last week , a texas judge ruled that the state will temporarily retain custody of the 437 children removed in the raid . meanwhile , on tuesday evening , laboratory workers at san angelo coliseum completed taking dna samples from mothers and children , said janice rolfe , a spokeswoman for the state attorney general 's office . she did not say how many samples were taken . about 100 of the seized children from whom swab dna samples had already been taken were bused tuesday from the san angelo coliseum to group foster homes , the texas department of health and family services said . on wednesday , workers in eldorado continued to take voluntary dna samples from adults who live on the yfz ranch , rolfe said . rolfe said that at least 54 samples from adults have been taken there . the dna samples will be sent to laboratory corporation of america , based in burlington , north carolina . it could take longer than a month to get results . judge barbara walther , who last week ordered the dna testing of the children and ordered that they remain in state custody , signed an order this week authorizing the children 's move to foster care , officials said . at a meeting wednesday afternoon , walther and the state 's child protective services division agreed that 18 mothers with breast-feeding babies that are 1 year old or younger will be allowed to stay with their children in the homes where the children are placed . also , 23 mothers with 28 children ages 1 to 2 years will be allowed to stay in the same towns as their children . the remaining children , 2 to 18 years old , will be split up into available homes . the original order signed by walther called for every effort to keep siblings together , especially in the case of small children . rod parker , a spokesman for the flds families , blasted the action in a news conference from his salt lake city , utah , office . `` the cps department of texas is afraid of due process , '' he said . `` they would lose in a fair fight in this case , and that is why you 're seeing them move so quickly , and that is why you 're seeing them move unilaterally .

'' watch cutts ' tearful apology '' he thanked davis ' family for taking care of the other child he had with davis . blake was 2 1/2 at the time of his mother 's murder in june 2007 . `` i pray that you find peace and you someday find room for forgiveness , '' he said . earlier , cutts ' mother , renee , jones , had told jurors , `` i do n't know what i would do without him . '' she described cutts as a former honor student who loved his job as a police officer . `` he was my firstborn , my only son , '' jones testified tearfully . `` he means so much to me , '' she continued . `` he used to call me three , four times a day . '' watch cutts react as his mother pleads for his life . cutts ' punishment is being decided by the same jury of six men and six women who found him guilty . all the jurors are white ; cutts is african-american . cutts ' sister , father and one of his school teachers also testified . judge charles e. brown ordered jurors to return early tuesday for attorneys ' closing arguments . when the arguments conclude , jurors will begin their deliberations . if jurors do not agree on the death penalty , cutts could receive a possible sentence of life in prison without parole or become eligible for parole in 20 , 25 or 30 years . jones , was the first witness called to the stand by the defense . she said her son was a good youngster who was active in sports , scouts and his church . `` i never had any trouble out of him , '' she said as cutts teared up at the defense table . she said cutts ' relationship with his father deteriorated after the parents split . a former teacher described cutts as a social child given the nickname `` gobble '' by his classmates . he was helpful in class , often volunteering to pick stray crayons up from the floor . his father testified that he gave cutts the nickname `` gobble '' because as an infant he resembled '' a little butterball turkey . '' he said cutts was a `` gifted child '' in school . he blamed himself for the break up of his marriage , saying his drinking and gambling contributed to it . cutts ' own personal life was rocky , according to testimony . davis was nine months pregnant when she disappeared in june 2007 . her body was found in a northeastern ohio park after a 10-day search that brought national media attention . he is blake 's father , as well as the father of the unborn girl , chloe . according to testimony , cutts , 30 , rolled davis ' body in a comforter and dumped it in a park , leaving toddler son blake in the house alone at the crime scene in a soiled diaper . `` mommy 's in the rug , '' blake told police , according to testimony . during the guilt phase of the trial , cutts sobbed on the witness stand as he admitted killing davis and chloe . but cutts insisted that their deaths were an accident . `` i did n't mean to hurt her , '' cutts testified , clasping a handful of tissues . `` this is n't real , '' he said he kept telling himself . prosecutors discounted cutts ' story , claiming he buckled under the financial pressure of child support , killed the mother of his child and then created a cover story to try to get away with it . on the stand , cutts said he went to pick up his son , blake , and became agitated when davis , 26 , was n't moving fast enough to get the boy ready . he said he tried to leave her house , but she grabbed him to keep him from leaving , and he accidentally elbowed her in the throat . cutts told the jury he performed cpr on davis and then tried to revive her with bleach . when he realized davis was dead , cutts said he panicked and put her in the back of his truck , so blake would n't have to see his mother . e-mail to a friend .
449	boston , massachusetts -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it all started with the flush of an automatic toilet . the terrifying sound marked the beginning of a two-year nightmare for sarah teres as she desperately tried to potty train her daughter molly . molly graduated from potty school four days before her brother , archer , was born . `` it was awful '' teres said . `` we tried everything including bribery and threats . '' teres , the mother of three from andover , massachusetts , hoped her middle child would be toilet trained by the time she was 2 1/2 . two years later , the girl was still in diapers , refusing to use the bathroom . `` i was going crazy , '' teres admitted . `` she would n't poop . she would hold it for days . '' at wits end , teres enrolled molly in the toilet training school at children 's hospital boston . `` by the time the children come in with their families , it has become a power struggle , '' explained dr. alison schonwald , a pediatrician who supervises the `` poop school , '' as it 's affectionately called by staffers . `` the kids kind of dig in their heels and put a line in the sand . '' health minute : watch more on the perils of potty training '' the american academy of pediatrics reports that most children show signs they 're ready to potty train between 18 and 24 months . doctors suggest a child may be ready to start trying if he 's staying dry for at least two hours at a time during the day , walking to and from the bathroom , asking for a diaper change and asking to use the potty . for some kids , the toilet training process can take more than a year , or longer . the six-week program at children 's hospital is one of a handful around the country . kimberly dunn , a pediatric nurse practitioner , has worked with some of the 450 young graduates over the years . she said most of the kids admit they are afraid to use a toilet . `` oftentimes , the parents come in and they want to know why they 're afraid , '' dunn said . `` you could ask the kids until they 're blue in the face and you hardly ever find out why . '' dunn meets with a half-dozen children once a week . she uses books , music and art to help the students overcome their fear of using the toilet . she helps them set small , realistic goals . for instance , she said , week one involved just sitting on the toilet for five minutes . she encourages positive reinforcement and simple rewards such as extra playtime with mom or dad . while dunn works on the kids , psychologist elaine leclair , an instructor at the harvard school of medicine , offers frank advice to the parents in a separate room . `` i just say , ` step back . ' they hate to hear me say this , but i say whatever you 're doing now is not working . you really need to try something different , '' leclair said . she said many parents come to the sessions angry and anxious . `` they come in feeling extremely discouraged , very isolated thinking they are the only ones in the world who have this problem . '' teres acknowledged that 's how she felt . `` imagine my surprise to find out there were thousands of kids who had this problem . '' after years of hiding her daughter 's toilet training troubles from family and friends , the group parenting sessions allowed teres to open up about her frustrations . `` it was like going to betty ford , '' joked teres , who felt she had exhausted all her other options . a majority of the children who attend the children 's hospital class are dealing with constipation issues often caused by delayed toilet training . teres learned that her daughter had a medical condition called encopresis . experts call it a symptom of chronic constipation and say it occurs when a child resists having a bowel movement . youngsters like molly are sometimes given laxatives or other medications to help encourage them to go . schonwald , the author of `` the pocket idiot 's guide to potty training , '' does n't want parents to be discouraged during the process . `` no one goes to college in diapers , right ? everyone will get through this time , as awful as it might feel if you 're struggling . '' she suggested achieving success during potty training has to do with the approach . `` there are three things you can not make a child do : eat , sleep or poop . we find that by decreasing the pressure and expectations that children feel more confident . '' schonwald reminds parents that toilet training `` is not a chore , so keeping it positive from the very beginning is the most important thing . '' if a child is n't using the toilet by the age of 4 , she recommends talking with a pediatrician . schonwald also said setbacks during potty training are normal . `` all developmental skills come in spurts with periods of regression . '' after a setback , schonwald advises parents to give their child positive messages that they can succeed by saying , `` so you had some accidents today . we 'll try again tomorrow . '' four months after graduating from `` poop school , '' teres is relieved to report that molly is fully toilet trained . `` you would never know this was an issue , '' said teres . `` she even used an automatic flush toilet the other day . i waited to see her reaction and she was ok .

450	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- some democrats say they fear their party 's method of picking a nominee might turn undemocratic as neither presidential candidate is likely to gather the delegates needed for the nomination . the democrats ' superdelegate system is supposed to avoid turmoil at the party 's conventions . sens. hillary clinton and barack obama are running neck and neck toward the party 's august convention in denver , colorado . most projections show neither getting the necessary 2,025 delegates in the remaining nominating contests before then . party rules call for the votes of superdelegates -- 800 or so party officers , elected officials and activists -- to tip the balance . the party instituted the system to avoid the turmoil that a deadlocked race would create at a convention . but even some superdelegates are questioning the system , as the party heads toward the conclusion of a race in which they might determine the outcome . `` it 's not the most democratic way of doing things , '' said maine superdelegate sam spencer . watch the scenario for a `` civil war '' in the democratic party '' at least two organizations have launched petition drives to reflect how the vote went in primaries and caucuses . moveon.org , which has endorsed obama , is trying to get 200,000 signatures this week and plans to run an ad with its petition in usa today . and democracy for america , headed by democratic national committee chairman howard dean 's brother jim , said it will deliver signed petitions to all the superdelegates . while pledged delegates are allocated with the understanding they 'll vote the way their state went in its primary or caucus , superdelegates are free to vote however they want . and even if they pledge their support to a candidate , they 're free to change at any time . clinton already has 234 superdelegates and obama has 157 . but obama has a sizable lead in pledged delegates , 1,096 to 977 , and is on a roll , having won all eight nominating contests since super tuesday . see which states pledged delegates come from '' if the superdelegates were to tip the balance against the popular vote , the turmoil would last long beyond the convention , longtime democratic party strategist tad devine said . `` if a perception develops that somehow this decision has been made not by voters participating in primaries or caucuses , but by politicians in some mythical backroom , i think that the public could react strongly against that , '' devine said . `` the problem is -lsb- if -rsb- people perceive that voters have not made the decision -- instead , insiders have made the decision -- then all of these new people who are being attracted to the process , particularly the young people who are voting for the first time , will feel disenfranchised or in some way alienated , '' he said . superdelegates were established in 1982 to bring more moderate democrats back to conventions , where their attendance had been dropping since the 1950s , and to relect the party 's mainstream more accurately . '' -lsb- superdelegates -rsb- are the keepers of the faith , '' said former san francisco , california , mayor willie brown . `` you have superdelegates because this is the democratic party . you do n't want the bleed-over from the green party , the independents and others in deciding who your nominee will be . '' devine was part of the first campaign to benefit from the roles of superdelegates -- that of former vice president walter mondale in 1984 . mondale 's 1984 campaign went into the party convention with too few delegates to secure the nomination against the campaigns of former sen. gary hart and jesse jackson . mondale had received more votes , but hart had won more states . mondale was able to line up the superdelegates going into the convention and avoid a fight on the convention floor . each campaign actively is trying to encourage the unpledged delegates to pledge to their side . jason rae , a 21-year-old wisconsin superdelegate , said he 's gotten calls from former president clinton and former secretary of state madeleine albright from hillary clinton 's camp , and obama 's wife , michelle , visited with him during a campaign stop tuesday in wisconsin . rae said he has n't yet decided how he 'll vote in wisconsin 's primary on tuesday . crystal strait , a party activist from california , said she 's received calls from clinton herself and daughter chelsea but she remains uncommitted . massachusetts superdelegate john walsh said he 'll stay loyal to obama despite the fact that the senator lost the primary in walsh 's state . so will fellow massachusetts superdelegates sens. edward kennedy and john kerry . among clinton 's committed superdelegates are harold ickes jr. , her husband 's former deputy chief of staff ; terry mcauliffe , who led her husband 's 1996 re-election campaign and is chairman of her campaign ; and her husband . whether those superdelegates stay committed to their candidates , even if it means tipping the outcome of the race against the pledged delegate lead or the popular vote , could split the party . `` it 's in a total contradiction of the way the democrats have set up their primary process , with all this proportional representation , '' said cnn political analyst amy holmes . `` the whole point of it was that no one could walk away with the elites . and if this is decided by superdelegates , i think the democratic party morally is going to be looking at each other and say , ` what did we just do ? ' '' devine said it could hurt the party in the general election . `` i think it will hurt us particularly because so many of the policies that we 're saying we will pursue in government as democrats are based on fairness , whether it 's the tax policies that we advocate or the social programs we want to advance , there 's a fairness component in all of that , '' he said . `` people need to believe , i think , that our process is fair as well , if they want to believe that our policies will be fair .

451	adelaide , australia -- world record-breaking wicketkeeper adam gilchrist has announced he will retire from cricket at the end of the australian summer . adam gilchrist takes a spectacular catch off mahendra singh dhoni in the third test against india . the 36-year-old chose australia day to make his decision public , coming at the end of the third day of the fourth and final test against india in adelaide . gilchrist said he would retire from tests at the end of the current match , and then hang up his gloves in one-day internationals after the upcoming tri-series with sri lanka and india . `` it is with great pride and happiness that i make the decision to retire from tests and one-day internationals , '' he said in a statement on saturday . `` i 've come to the decision after much thought and discussion with those most important to me . `` my family and i have been fortunate to have had an amazing journey full of rich experiences throughout my career and are sincerely grateful to all who have helped make this stage of our lives so fulfilling . `` i am now ready and excited to move into the next phase of my life which will , of paramount importance , include much more time with my family . '' gilchrist broke the world record for the most wicketkeeping dismissals in tests with 414 on friday , overtaking south africa 's mark boucher in his 96th outing in the five-day game . boucher , by comparison , played in 109 tests . gilchrist took over the gloves from ian healy -- third on the list with 395 dismissals from 119 tests -- in november 1999 , and went on to establish himself both as a wicketkeeper and as a batsman of brutal hitting capabilities . he has scored 5,556 runs to date , at an average of 47.89 , with a highest score of 204 not out and having made 17 centuries . he has been similarly prolific in 277 one-dayers , scoring 9,297 runs at an average of 36 and reaching three figures 15 times . gilchrist 's revelation came as australia put themselves in a strong position to win the series against the touring indians , reaching 322-3 at stumps . captain ricky ponting , whose team lead 2-1 , was unbeaten on 79 after adding an unbroken 81 for the fourth wicket with michael clarke -lrb- 37 -rrb- . resuming the day on 62-0 in reply to india 's imposing first innings of 526 , matthew hayden and phil jaques took their opening stand to 159 . jaques was the first to fall , bowled by india captain anil kumble for a patient 60 off 159 deliveries . hayden , on his return after missing the defeat in perth due to a hamstring injury , reached his 30th test century before being bowled by 19-year-old seamer ishant sharma for 103 off 200 balls . ponting , who came in at first drop , added another 55 with mike hussey before the left-hander was also castled by fast bowler irfan pathan for 22 to leave the home side teetering a little at 241-3 . but ponting , who has struggled for form so far in the series , ground out his 40th half-century in tests and clarke provided able support to take australia through to the close of play with no further loss of wickets . e-mail to a friend .
452	bogota , colombia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- colombian police have killed a drug trafficker who the government says is one of the most sought-after fugitive outside the country 's rebel leaders . victor manuel mejia munera was a drug lord with ties to paramilitary groups , the colombian government says . victor manuel mejia munera and two bodyguards were killed tuesday when police tracked them down on a farm in the northwestern province of antioquia , according to a statement on the colombian presidency web site . three people also were arrested , according to the statement . mejia munera was wearing an american-style , desert-camouflage uniform when he was killed , said colombian defense minister juan manuel santos . mejia munera also had short - and long-range weapons with ammunition , the presidential statement said . `` this is a great strike of the public force against the criminal structures of the country , '' santos said , warning that drug traffickers who do not turn themselves over to the government will `` end up in the jail or in a tomb . '' in terms of the country 's most-wanted list , mejia munera was one of colombia 's most sought-after criminals and ranked just below the leaders of revolutionary armed forces of colombia , the statement said . the leftist guerilla group , which goes by its spanish acronym farc , holds about 750 hostages in the jungles of colombia and has justified hostage-taking as a legitimate military tactic in a long-running civil war involving government forces , drug traffickers and right-wing paramilitaries . mejia munera is not alleged to have ties to farc , but he had been involved with a right-wing paramilitary group known as united self-defense forces of colombia , according to the u.s. state department . mejia munera and his brother , miguel angel mejia munera , known as `` los mellizos , '' or `` the twins , '' have been accused of running major drug rings in colombia . the brothers also have faced narcotics-trafficking charges in the united states . santos initially told reporters that police had killed miguel angel mejia munera . the colombian presidency later said the slain drug lord was actually victor manuel mejia munera . fingerprints confirmed that the dead man was victor mejia munera , colombian-based caracol radio reported . the brothers sometimes exchanged identities , the radio station said , and identity documents belonging to miguel mejia munera were found near victor mejia munera . in 2004 , the u.s. district court for the district of columbia indicted the twins on narcotics-trafficking charges . the u.s. justice department at one point offered a $ 5 million reward for `` true and effective information '' on the whereabouts of a dozen suspects it wanted extradited to the united states . one of the 12 men wanted was miguel mejia munera . the state department said wednesday there was no reward for victor mejia munera . the u.s. treasury department 's office of foreign assets control reported that the brothers have been involved in narcotics trafficking since the early 1990s , when they were guarding ships carrying cocaine from western colombia to mexico . `` over time , '' ofac said in a news release last year , the brothers `` rose through the ranks to lead their own narcotics trafficking organization . '' `` recent reports indicate that los mellizos may be funding their own illegal armed groups to facilitate their narcotics trafficking activities , '' the release said . the colombian prosecutor general 's office had indicted victor mejia munera for his role in a 2004 paramilitary massacre of 11 farmers in tame in the eastern colombian province of arauca , according to the state department . e-mail to a friend .
453	rome , italy -- captain javier zanetti saved inter milan 's unbeaten serie a record as he rifled home a stunning late volley to earn a 1-1 draw against second-placed roma at the san siro on wednesday . zanetti celebrates his late strike as inter retained their unbeaten serie a record with a 1-1 draw against roma . roma captain francesco totti had given the visitors a deserved first-half leadbut zanetti 's strike two minutes from time maintained inter 's nine-point lead at the top . roma needed to win to breathe new life into the title race but they were dealt a cruel blow as french defender philippe mexes was sent-off late on for two bookings in quick succession . inter capitalised and they have now lost only once in their last 65 league matches . the home side had the first clear-cut chance of the match and were within centimeters of taking the lead when hernan crespo met a cross from patrick vieira with an acrobatic volley , but saw his effort cannon back off the post . the defending champions were made to pay for that miss on 38 minutes as the visitors orchestrated a sublime goal . neat footwork from macedonia international mirko vucinic released max tonetto down the left and his pin-point cross was flicked home at the near post by totti from six meters out as he stole in front of defender cristian chivu . inter center-back nicolas burdisso should have restored parity in first-half stoppage time but his header from luis figo 's corner flew over the bar . figo himself had a great chance on 54 minutes but after having time to set himself up for an attempted volley , he skewed his effort so badly that it did not even go out of play . after mexes ' dismissal 10 from time , inter laid siege to roma 's goal . goalkeeper doni had to be alert to tip over crespo 's header three minutes from time but he could do nothing about zanetti 's volley a minute later . meanwhile , ac milan slipped to fifth place as they were held to a 1-1 draw at catania . brazilian teenager pato gave them the lead early in the second half with a skimming long-range shot but substitute gionathan spinesi 's header earnt the sicilians a point . fiorentina are up to fourth after they defeated livorno 1-0 at home thanks to a goal from senegal forward ndiaye papa waigo . e-mail to a friend .
454	glasgow , scotland -- jean-claude darcheville and nacho novo both scored twice to fire leaders rangers to a 4-0 win at hearts , their 10th consecutive scottish premier league victory . jean-claude darcheville scored two first-half goals as rangers cruised to a 4-0 victory at hearts . hearts found themselves ripped apart by a rampant rangers side , who sent out a clear message to rivals celtic by maintaining their four-point advantage at the summit . darcheville claimed the opener after 25 minutes , cutting inside from the left and squeezing his shot inside the far post from a tight angle . the same player added a second two minutes before the break , scoring from close range after a barry ferguson corner was not cleared . darcheville was withdrawn for novo at the interval , but if hearts thought the departure of the frenchman meant some much-needed respite , they were sadly mistaken . novo was on the pitch for seven minutes when he helped himself to a goal of his own . charlie adam set up the shot with a low ball across goal and all that was required from the striker was to bundle home from close range . the same two players combined again to supply rangers with their fourth goal with 69 minutes gone . adam was again the provider and this time novo produced a cheeky back-heel finish from five meters . meanwhile , goals by scott mcdonald and georgios samaras gave celtic a hard-fought 2-1 win at home to inverness caledonian thistle . australian international mcdonald 's 25th goal of the season right on the interval gave the champions the lead and his greek team-mate bulleted an aiden mcgeady cross past goalkeeper michael fraser on the hour mark . but the final minutes were needlessly fraught for celtic after caley striker marius niculae took advantage of scott brown 's misplaced pass to pull a goal back in the 70th minute . e-mail to a friend .

459	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- ever find yourself struggling to craft the perfect sentence for a loved one who 's , um , serving a sentence ? now , you have a friend in the greeting card business . terrye cheathem has created a line of greeting cards geared toward prison inmates . a los angeles , california , lawyer has come up with a series of cards geared toward prison inmates , a rapidly growing segment of the u.s. population . some express simple good wishes : `` we are all praying for you while you do your time . '' others celebrate holidays : `` you had the choice to be ` naughty or nice . ' and you chose ... now you have to do your time . but , christmas wo n't be the same without you here . '' others dole out tough love : `` when you called last time , i was not very sympathetic . i guess that i have heard your promises to change too many times . please - stop promising to change . just do it . '' creator terrye cheathem said the cards let family members say `` look , things need to be different when you get out . '' she came up with the idea a few years ago while looking -- without success -- for a birthday card to send her brother-in-law , who was serving an 11-month sentence . `` there are so many people who have mixed feelings about communicating with their loved ones in prison , '' cheathem said thursday . `` they are unhappy , oftentimes profoundly embarrassed . people do n't know what to say . '' so she created three squares greetings to capture the sentiments for a captive audience -- one that seems to be getting larger each year . more than 2.3 million people were in jails or prisons in the united states at the beginning of 2008 , according to a study released last month by the pew center on the states . the center is a private organization that advocates for alternative programs to alleviate prison populations . for the first time in the nation 's history , the center says , more than one in 100 americans are behind bars , a higher proportion than any other country . cheathem is selling her cards online and through stores . she also wants jails and prisons to carry cards designed for inmates to send their relatives . `` they 're ` thank you ' cards , '' she said . '' ` thank you for visiting , ' ` thank you for bringing the kids , ' ` thank you for coming to court . ' '' like many , bookstore owner james fugate was at first reluctant to carry the line in his los angeles shop , esowon books . `` i have some issues of being nice to criminals , '' fugate said . `` and in my 20 years in business , i 've seen some relatives who do n't seem to realize the gravity of what -lrb- their family members -rrb- have done . '' fugate said he changed his mind when he realized that most of the cards carried messages asking inmates to turn their lives around . cheathem understands the hesitation of shoppers and sellers . `` i ca n't think of any other product that anyone wants to receive and certainly no one wants to be in the position to buy one , '' she said . `` but there is a need for this . '' cheathem points to mayor kwame kilpatrick of detroit , michigan . he was charged this week with perjury , obstruction of justice and misconduct of office . he was released on a $ 75,000 bond . `` i have a card that says , ` i 'm sorry to hear about your arrest , ' '' she said . `` right now , there are probably 50 people or more who would send it to him .

461	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- army gen. david petraeus , the top u.s. commander in iraq , has been chosen to become chief of u.s. central command , defense secretary robert gates said wednesday . gen. david petraeus has been the commander in iraq for more than a year . petraeus would replace adm. william fallon , who said last month that he was resigning . fallon said widespread , but false , reports that he was at odds with the bush administration over iran had made his job impossible . in addition , gates said , army lt. gen. ray odierno , commander of the multinational corps-iraq -- the no. 2 position in iraq -- is being nominated to fill petraeus ' post . odierno has been home from iraq for only a couple of months but has agreed to return , gates said . the plan is for petraeus to leave iraq in late summer or early fall , gates said , to ensure a smooth transition and plenty of time for odierno to prepare . `` we expect to move the paperwork on these nominations to the white house and to the senate very quickly , '' gates said . `` because of the complexity of this series of moves , i respectfully ask the senate to move on them expeditiously , hopefully by memorial day , so the families and we can plan appropriately . '' odierno was in line for a pentagon desk job as army vice chief just over a year after helping petraeus implement the `` surge '' in u.s. troops in iraq . the pentagon says petraeus will stay in iraq long enough to make the first recommendation on further troop cuts after the surge is over . watch the challenges ahead of petraeus '' gates said the generals ' promotions reflected an endorsement of the current course in iraq . `` the course certainly that gen. petraeus has set has been a successful course . so , frankly , i think staying that course is not a bad idea . i would say it 's a good idea , '' gates said . watch gates nominate petraeus '' central command , which oversees u.s. forces in east africa , the middle east and central asia , has its headquarters at macdill air force base in tampa , florida . gates said odierno is well known to troops in iraq , to military leadership and to iraqis , and `` i believe , in most parts of the world , especially in the middle east , personal relationships make a difference . '' `` i believe that this arrangement will probably preserve the likelihood of continued momentum and progress , '' gates said . the defense secretary said he expects to easily win senate approval for the nominations once they are made by president bush . he said he had spoken with sens. carl levin , d-michigan ; john mccain , r-arizona ; and john warner , r-virginia , and `` i do n't really anticipate any problems . '' in a press release wednesday , mccain praised the move . `` both of these great generals have served our country with skill and distinction , and i am pleased that they will continue to do so in positions of high responsibility , '' mccain wrote . gates acknowledged that fallon 's `` decision to step down was unexpected . '' `` i had intended that adm. fallon probably stay on for a third year . his second year would have ended in february , '' he said . `` so i 'm faced with a critical combatant command where a commander is needed -- and a commander who knows what 's going on in the region . '' asked whether he was using petraeus `` almost as a finger in the dike '' because of the shortage of army generals with expertise in counterinsurgency warfare , gates admitted that there are few army officers with experience in and knowledge of iraq . odierno served as commander of the 4th infantry division , the unit that captured former iraqi president saddam hussein . petraeus was picked in january 2007 to replace gen. george casey as the chief commander in iraq and won senate confirmation that month . he previously served as head of the u.s. army combined arms center and as a commander in iraq , and he was one of the main writers of an army manual on counterinsurgency efforts . he was seen as the logical choice to replace fallon . in his new post , he will oversee u.s. forces in all the middle east , not only iraq and afghanistan . `` i recommended him to the president because i am absolutely confident he is the best man for the job , '' gates said . in testimony to congress this month , petraeus said iranian agents have played a `` destructive role '' in iraq by backing shiite militants , called `` special groups '' by the united states . the u.s. believes that iran 's islamic revolutionary guard corps quds force is behind the support for militants . `` unchecked , the special groups pose the greatest long-term threat to the viability of a democratic iraq , '' petraeus testified . last month , in an interview with cnn 's kyra phillips in baghdad , petraeus acknowledged some `` friction '' between himself and fallon in the past year , but `` actually , over the last six months or so , our relationship was really very , very good . '' `` there was friction in the beginning . he has a different job than i have , '' petraeus said . `` there can be understandable differences of your take , if you will , on a situation . as they say in politics and government 101 , where you stand on an issue sometimes depends on where you sit in the organization , and we sit in different chairs .

462	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a man , incensed that a 6-year-old girl chose to walk through a path reserved for upper caste villagers , pushed her into burning embers , police in north india said wednesday . she was seriously burned . dalits , or `` untouchables , '' are victims of discrimination in india despite laws aimed at eliminating prejudice . the girl is a dalit , or an `` untouchable , '' according to india 's traditional caste system . india 's constitution outlaws caste-based discrimination , and barriers have broken down in large cities . prejudice , however , persists in some rural areas of the country . the girl was walking with her mother down a path in the city of mathura when she was accosted by a man in his late teens , said police superintendent r.k. chaturvedi . `` he scolded them both and pushed her , '' chaturvedi said . the girl fell about 3 to 4 feet into pile of burning embers by the side of the road . the girl remained in critical condition wednesday . the man confessed to the crime and was charged with attempted murder , chaturvedi said . the assault took place in india 's uttar pradesh state , about 150 km -lrb- 93 miles -rrb- south of delhi . the state is governed by mayawati , a woman who goes by one name and is india 's most powerful dalit politician . her bahujan samaj party seeks to get more political representation for dalits , who are considered so low in the social order that they do n't even rank among the four classes that make up the caste system . hindus believe there are five main groups of people , four of which sprang from the body of the first man . the brahmin class comes from the mouth . they are the priests and holy men , the most elevated of the castes . next is the ksatriyas , the kings , warriors and soldiers created from the arms . the vaisyas come from the thighs . they are the merchants and traders of society . and the sudras , or laborers , come from the feet . the last group is the dalits , or the `` untouchables .

463	baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- six u.s. troops were killed in iraq on monday , making 2007 the deadliest for the american military in the iraq war . the grim record came despite lower death rates in recent months , which were not enough to offset death tolls that topped 100 during three months in the spring . four soldiers were killed when a roadside bomb exploded near their vehicle in northern iraq 's tameem province ; another died in combat in anbar province . a sailor was killed in salaheddin province `` as a result of injuries sustained from an explosion while conducting operations , '' the military said . according to a cnn count of pentagon figures , 853 u.s. service members have died so far in 2007 . the next highest death toll was in 2004 , when 849 were killed . the total number of u.s. military deaths in iraq stands at 3,856 , including seven civilian contractors of the defense department . the high number of deaths this year corresponds with the u.s. troop buildup called the `` surge '' and a crackdown on insurgents in and near baghdad . monthly death tolls were highest in the first part of the year : 83 deaths in january , 81 in february and 81 in march . numbers peaked in the next three months , with 104 deaths in april , 126 in may and 101 in june . the numbers have dropped from that level since -- with 78 in july , 84 in august , 65 in september , 38 in october and 12 so far in november . civilian deaths have also dropped in recent months , u.s. and iraqi authorities say . the iraq war began in march of 2003 and in that year there were 486 u.s. military deaths . in 2004 , major offensives were responsible for many fatalities , including the massive operation in falluja in november and fighting between u.s. troops and shiite militants in najaf . the number of deaths in 2005 was 846 and in 2006 it was 822 . the u.s. military also announced on tuesday that it intends to release nine detained iranians in iraq `` in the coming days , '' a move that dovetails with the american hope that iranian authorities are honoring a recent pledge to stop iranian help to insurgents in iraq . `` these individuals have been assessed to have no continuing value '' and do n't pose a `` further threat '' to iraqi security , said rear adm. gregory smith . two of them are from the `` irbil 5 '' detained in january . irbil is the largest city in the kurdish area of iraq . the u.s. military had accused the five iranians arrested in irbil of having links to iran 's islamic revolutionary guard-quds force , a military unit accused of aiding insurgent activity -- including the distribution of roadside bombs . smith said tuesday that materials for roadside bombs `` do not appear to have arrived into iraq after the iranians have made their pledge to stop arming , funding and training extremists . '' `` we hope in the coming weeks and months to confirm that iran has indeed honored its pledge through further verification that the flow of ammunitions and other lethal aid has indeed stopped , '' said smith , who noted that iran , iraq and the united states plan to hold another round of security talks . last month , gen. david petraeus , the top-ranking u.s. military official in iraq , told cnn the iranian ambassador had given assurances to his iraqi counterpart that such training and supplying of insurgents would end . meanwhile , a kurdistan regional government official on tuesday confirmed to cnn that two iranian consulates had been established in the region , offices created in the wake of the arrests in irbil . at the time of the arrests , iran insisted the arrested officials were `` diplomats '' working in a diplomatic mission , while iraq 's foreign ministry and the u.s. military said it was a `` liaison '' office which did not have diplomatic status . one of the new consulates is in a building in irbil that had been closed down during the january raid , the kurdistan official said . also tuesday , the u.s. military reported that u.s. and iraqi troops found 22 corpses buried in iraq 's lake tharthar region . the iraqi army and local security forces `` are investigating the mass grave to determine the identities of the deceased and the causes of death for notification of their families , '' the military said . lake tharthar is in both anbar and salaheddin provinces and northwest of baghdad . u.s. and iraqi troops have been conducting an operation in the same region since sunday to target al qaeda in iraq . so far , they have found and destroyed two car bomb facilities and a number of weapons caches and detained 30 men . the military also said that coalition troops on tuesday killed eight people described as terrorists and detained 10 suspects in operations targeting al qaeda and foreign militant networks in central and northern iraq . the military also said an operation involving iraqi forces in the tikrit area on october 30 led to the detention of 39 `` suspected insurgents '' and the discovery of a torture cell , a mobile hospital , car bombs , rocket-propelled grenades , machine guns and a katyusha rocket . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's jennifer deaton contributed to this report .
464	greensburg , kansas -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- there are still piles of bricks and rubble on countless streets in greensburg , kansas , a year after a tornado demolished more than 90 percent of the town . on may 4 , 2007 , a ferocious twister blasted greensburg , kansas , killing 11 people in the town of 1,400 . yet what is happening in the city 's rebuilding process may not only re-invent greensburg but provide a model for `` green '' building everywhere . just a week after the deadly tornado hit may 4 , 2007 , a similar idea sparked in the mayor , a representative from the governor 's office and a nonprofit expert from a nearby town . the concept : if the whole town had to be rebuilt anyway , why not be bold and build it as a global example of conservation , energy efficiency and creativity ? daniel wallach , the nonprofit specialist , soon got the green light to help residents and businesses start over in a project known as greensburg greentown . `` kansas is known for being very conservative , '' wallach said . watch how the town went green '' `` my first order of business was to listen . what i heard were a lot of concerns about politicization and being associated with ` tree huggers . ' i helped frame it with the people here in such a way they saw , this is their movement , '' he said . fifth-generation greensburg resident anita hohl joined the staff of greensburg greentown as a web specialist . `` i was pretty green to begin with . i used to get teased about being a tree hugger . now it 's ` the thing ! ' this has really brought us so much closer together . what you can accomplish when just a few people are working toward the same goal is amazing , '' she said . her farming grandparents instilled the virtue of being energy-efficient . `` my grandma always put her clothes on the line , did her own gardening and re-used everything , '' hohl said . hohl and her husband , a daughter , a son , four cats , a dog and two birds are among the greensburg residents in `` femaville , '' a cluster of mobile homes set up as temporary housing . the family hopes to break ground soon for their new house and move in by thanksgiving . although they have made the best of the cramped quarters , she says , there are some challenges . `` it sort of feels like living in a cheap motel ! but it 's a lot better than it could be . it 's nice to have a place to be , '' she said . from the start , the greentown staff knew that getting the business community on board with the green plan was vital . and in rural america , there is no business that 's more of a bedrock than the john deere dealership . in greensburg , that dealership has been in the estes family for four generations . their facility was wiped out by the twister . `` the building was a total loss . and we saved only 13 pieces of machinery out of 220 on the lot , '' kelly estes said . `` the fema guy said he had never seen anything like it . steel twisted into brick , and then the miles per hour needed to pick up combines that weigh 25,000 pounds and move them half a mile in the air , '' he said . kelly and his brother mike decided to rebuild in town to the highest green-building standard . the u.s. green building council establishes a rating system for efficient buildings called leed , or leadership in energy and environmental design . the greensburg facility is aiming for leed platinum , the most demanding standard . there is one wind turbine on their new property , a 100-foot structure designed to generate 5 kilowatts of electricity . it is providing power for the construction site . although `` green '' may be viewed as trendy and new by some , mike estes knows that it is not for show . `` we 're looking at saving money here ; truthfully , we are . we 're running a business . if we ca n't make this make sense , why would we do it ? '' he asked . and he says the non-political approach of the city in encouraging energy efficiency has helped . `` i do n't think it 's red or blue to be green ; i think green is green , and green makes sense . and green saves you green ! '' he said with a laugh . being a model for the world in energy efficiency is a major goal of greensburg greentown . but there is another even more urgent aim : keeping this rural town from disappearing . the lack of jobs in many small towns means that after teenagers graduate from high school , they have to leave to find other opportunities . `` the average age of people living in rural communities is in their 50s , '' wallach said . `` there are very few folks in the communities under that age , because there are just no jobs . families have been split up for decades . '' so in addition to the long-term goal of greensburg 's pre-tornado businesses from leaving , people hope to attract new green trade as well . the city wants to open a biodiesel facility as one of its first green newcomers . another long-term goal is to have 100 percent renewable energy . it is probable that the greatest contribution would come from large wind turbines . `` the timing of all this is , in some ways , almost spooky , '' wallach said . `` it 's like the world was ready for this to happen , for a town to be completely re-imagined . the tragedy was terrible . but the folks here know that it also provided an incredible opportunity .

465	johannesburg , south africa -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- white students at a south african university tricked black residence hall workers into eating stew containing urine , prompting a march wednesday in which five people were arrested , university officials said . students protest against a racist video on the campus of free state university in bloemfontein , south africa . the white students made a video of the incident , which they staged in reaction to the university 's efforts to integrate its residences , according to a statement from the university of the free state . the protesters on wednesday included black and white students who later marched to the residence where the video was made and demanded that it be shut down , witnesses said . the video surfaced on tuesday but was made in september , the university said . in the video , white male students at reitz residence are seen encouraging at least three black female housekeepers to participate in what the students call the `` reitz fear factor , '' an apparent reference to the television show in which contestants eat live worms or compete in other feats . watch excerpts of video that sparked outrage '' in one scene from the video , a student mixes what looks like a beef stew in a plastic bowl and adds garlic and other items . then he tells the camera he will add the `` special ingredient . '' the student then urinates into the mixture , which he later stirs up and puts in a microwave . other students can be heard laughing on the tape . the next scene shows a different student urging at least three housekeepers to drink cups full of the stew , saying , `` this is our dorm 's ` fear factor . ' we want to see who has the best ` fear factor . ' '' on the video , the student does not tell the women that there is urine in the mixture . the women , on their knees , spit the stew into buckets after tasting it . some appeared to vomit , but the women also laughed during the incident as the student urged them on . next , the women struggle to run in what appears to be a race . the video is put in slow-motion as the theme from `` chariots of fire '' plays . finally , one of the students awards a large bottle of whiskey to one of the women , telling her she has won the `` fear factor . '' at the end of the video , a message appears on the screen in afrikaans saying , `` that , at the end of the day , is what we think of integration . '' university officials and human rights groups in south africa denounced the video . `` the executive management of the -lsb- university -rsb- condemns this video in the strongest possible terms as a gross violation of the human dignity of the workers involved , '' said ufs rector frederick fourie in a statement posted on the university 's web site . `` we have immediately started with a most urgent investigation into this matter , '' he added . later wednesday , fourie met with the employees seen in the video and apologized to them , a statement from the university said . counseling is being provided for the workers , it added . the students involved in the video have been identified and will be suspended , fourie said , and charges against the men will be filed with the south african police service . two of the students in the video are still enrolled at the university but had been barred from the campus in bloemfontein , according to the university . two others completed their studies last year . the students seen in the video have not made any public comment since the video surfaced . `` i am deeply saddened that students apparently see nothing wrong in producing such an offensive and degrading video . i have publicly said several times that the ufs is not a place for racism , '' the rector 's statement said . `` the fact that it is openly linked to the integration process in ufs residences is also most disturbing , '' fourie said . a spokeswoman in free state province for the democratic alliance -- an opposition party which says it puts equal rights for all south africans at the center of its policies -- called the video `` shocking and inhumane . '' `` it looked like they were willing -lsb- participants -rsb- but they did n't know what purpose the video served . ... it was quite humiliating at the end to see the quite senior ladies on their knees eating the meat , '' said spokeswoman liana van wyk , the south african press association reported . helen zille , the democratic alliance 's leader , wednesday asked the south african human rights commission to conduct an investigation into racial tensions at the university . `` the abhorrent footage of students abusing university workers is a fundamental infringement on the victims ' constitutional right to have their dignity respected and protected , '' zille said in a statement posted on the group 's web site . `` this incident is symptomatic of racial tensions that have been simmering at the campus for some time over the issue of hostel -lsb- residence -rsb- integration , '' she said . fourie acknowledged in his statement that `` the university is going through a difficult time with its efforts to racially integrate its residences and to create a new residence culture based on diversity , respect , human dignity and human rights .

466	longyearbyen , norway -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a vast underground vault storing millions of seeds from around the world took delivery of its first shipment tuesday . the inside of one of the vaults at the svalbard global seed vault , on a remote island near the arctic ocean . dubbed the `` doomsday vault , '' the seed bank on a remote island near the arctic ocean is considered the ultimate safety net for the world 's seed collections , protecting them from a wide range of threats including war , natural disasters , lack of funding or simply poor agricultural management . norwegian musicians performed tuesday as part of an elaborate opening ceremony marking the opening of the vault , located 130 meters -lrb- 427 feet -rrb- inside a frozen mountain . wangari maathai , a kenyan environmental and political activist who won the 2004 nobel peace prize , placed the first seeds inside the vault , followed by other dignitaries . the inaugural shipment represent 268,000 distinct samples of seeds , with each sample containing a hundred-plus seeds and originating from a different farm or field around the world . in all , the shipment of seeds secured in the vault tuesday weighed approximately 10 tons , filling 676 boxes . the shipment amounts to a 100 million seeds in total , ranging from major african and asian food staples like maize , rice , and wheat to european and south american varieties of eggplant , lettuce , barley , and potato , according to the global crop diversity trust , which is paying to collect and maintain the seeds . watch as `` doomsday '' seed vault opens '' eventually the svalbard global seed vault , as it is officially known , will hold as many as 4.5 million distinct samples of seeds -- or some 2 billion seeds in total -- encompassing almost every variety of most important food crops in the world , the global crop diversity trust said . the norwegian government paid to build the vault in a mountainside near longyearbyen , in the remote svalbard islands between norway and the north pole . building began last year . the united nations founded the trust in 2004 to support the long-term conservation of crop diversity , and countries and foundations provide the funding . `` the seed vault is the perfect place for keeping seeds safe for centuries , '' said cary fowler , executive director of the trust . `` at these temperatures , seeds for important crops like wheat , barley and peas can last for up to 10,000 years . '' the vault 's location deep inside a mountain in the frozen north ensures the seeds can be stored safely no matter what happens outside . `` we believe the design of the facility will ensure that the seeds will stay well-preserved even if such forces as global warming raise temperatures outside the facility , '' said magnus bredeli tveiten , project manager for the norwegian government . the vault sits at the end of a 120-meter -lrb- 131-yard -rrb- tunnel blasted inside the mountain . workers used a refrigeration system to bring the vault to -18 degrees celsius -lrb- just below 0 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- , and a smaller refrigeration system plus the area 's natural permafrost and the mountain 's thick rock will keep the vault at at least -4 c -lrb- 25 f -rrb- . the vault at svalbard is similar to an existing seed bank in sussex , england , about an hour outside london . the british vault , called the millennium seed bank , is part of an scientific project that works with wild plants , as opposed to the seeds of crops . paul smith , the leader of the millennium seed bank project , said preserving the seeds of wild plants is just as important as preserving the seeds of vital crops . `` we must give ourselves every option in the future to use the whole array of plant diversity that is available to us , '' smith told cnn . the idea for the arctic seed bank dates to the 1980s but only became a possibility after the international treaty on plant genetic resources came into force in 2004 , the norwegian government said . the treaty provided an international framework for conserving and accessing crop diversity . svalbard is designed to store duplicates of seeds from seed collections around the world . the norwegian government says it has paid 50 million norwegian kroner -lrb- $ 9.4 million -rrb- to build the seed vault . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's becky anderson contributed to this report .

470	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. barack obama said thursday that the most important thing he could achieve as president would be to deal with iraq and the threat of al qaeda in afghanistan while improving `` our influence around the world . '' sen. barack obama , in his first interview since the north carolina and indiana primaries , speaks with wolf blitzer . in his first interview since the north carolina and indiana primaries , obama said he thinks the united states ' influence around the world has been diminishing . `` the world wants to see the united states lead . they 've been disappointed and disillusioned over the last seven , eight years , '' he told cnn 's wolf blitzer in an interview on `` the situation room . '' `` i think there is still a sense everywhere i go that if the united states regains its sense of who it is and our values and our ideals , that we will continue to set the tone for a more peaceful and prosperous world . '' watch the full interview with obama '' obama said he thinks the way the war in iraq has been handled has kept the united states from focusing on key issues like energy policy , global warming and the economy . americans want to succeed , he said , `` but we 're going to have to make some investments and ensure that the dynamism and the innovation of the american people is released . '' `` it 's very hard for us to do that when we 're spending close to $ 200 billion a year in other countries , rebuilding those countries instead of focusing on making ourselves strong , '' he said . obama downplayed headlines and stories , such as the cover of time magazine , that have declared him the democratic presidential nominee . `` i do n't want to be jinxed . we 've still got some work to do , '' he said . watch an analysis of some of obama 's comments '' obama predicted that he and sen. hillary clinton would probably split the remaining contests and said clinton would win the upcoming primary in west virginia by a `` big margin . '' obama won north carolina by a 14-point margin tuesday . clinton squeaked out a win in indiana by 2 points . in the days after those contests , some top democrats have called on clinton to step aside . obama deflected a question about a potential joint ticket with the new york senator , saying it 's too early to start thinking about running mates . `` sen. clinton has shown herself to be an extraordinary candidate . she 's tireless , she 's smart , she 's capable , and so obviously she 'd be on anybody 's short list to be a potential vice presidential candidate , '' he said . `` but it would be presumptuous of me at this point ... to somehow suggest that she should be my running mate . '' watch viewer responses to question : should obama offer clinton the no. 2 spot ? '' terry mcauliffe , a former democratic national committee chairman and a co-chairman of clinton 's campaign , commented thursday on the possibility of a joint ticket . `` i think what she 's interested in being the nominee of the party . ... we 're fighting hard for it . this woman has been working tirelessly through this campaign . ... hillary has earned the right to do whatever she wants to do . '' obama said he 's ready for what would be the next phase if he becomes the nominee : a matchup against sen. john mccain , the presumptive gop candidate . obama said he was offended when mccain said last month , `` it 's very clear who hamas wants to be the next president . '' `` i think it 's disappointing because john mccain always says , ` well , i 'm not going to run that kind of politics , ' and then to engage in that kind of smear i think is unfortunate , particularly since my policy on hamas has been no different than his , '' obama said . `` and so for him to toss out comments like that , i think , is an example of him losing his bearings as he pursues this nomination . '' when asked to respond to mccain supporters -- such as former massachusetts gov. mitt romney -- who have said obama is not ready to be commander in chief , the senator from illinois said he thinks what people are looking for is `` good judgment . '' `` i think i 've consistently displayed the kind of judgment that the american people are looking for in the next president , '' he said . watch obama say why he 's qualified to be president '' romney responded later on `` the situation room , '' saying `` the truth of the matter is just as i said , that he does n't have a record of accomplishments in the private sector or in the governmental sector ... has n't pushed a major piece of legislation . `` he seems like a charming guy who 's very well-spoken . but in terms of actually having led , actually having accomplished something , actually having a kind of leadership that america needs at a critical time with our economy ... he 's untested . ... frankly , sen. mccain is someone who is tested and very proven , '' he added .

'' but carrion also said he `` kind of understood '' the actions of the group . puerto rico and hawaii , along with guam and the philippines , were annexed into the united states in 1898 after the spanish-american war . guam and puerto rico remain territories of the united states . the philippines gained independence after world war ii , and hawaii became the 50th state in 1959 . although the monarchy was not overthrown until 1893 , its fate effectively was sealed six years earlier when the same group that forced the overthrow imposed a new constitution on king david kalakaua , who was forced to sign it under threat of arms . the document dramatically reduced the authority of the monarchy and instituted voter requirements that limited voting to wealthy businessmen and hawaiian landowners , barring 75 percent of the native hawaiian population and all asians . when queen lili'uokalani ascended the throne after the death of her brother in 1891 , she began work on a new constitution that would have effectively reversed the 1887 document . with the help of john l. stevens , the u.s. minister to hawaii , the elite group that had changed the constitution in 1887 opposed the queen 's actions . two years later , under threat of u.s. troops , she yielded her authority , saying , `` until such time as the government of the united states shall ... undo the action of its representative and reinstate me in the authority which i claim as the constitutional sovereign of the hawaiian islands . '' the queen was later imprisoned in iolani palace for eight months for her participation in an attempted 1895 revolt , until she relinquished her claim to the throne in return for her release . she died in 1917 at 79 . in 1993 , the u.s. congress approved , and president clinton signed , an apology to the people of the hawaiian islands . the document `` acknowledges that the overthrow of the kingdom of hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the united states and further acknowledges that the native hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the united states their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands , either through the kingdom of hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum . '' although it was used as a seat of government for decades after the deposition of lili'uokalani , the palace fell into disrepair . when the last of the government office moved out and into new facilities adjacent to the palace in 1969 , restoration work began . it opened to the public in 1978 . e-mail to a friend .

480	kampala , uganda -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a fight between ugandan and libyan presidential guards sparked chaos during a ceremony attended by the heads of state from 11 african nations on wednesday . libyan leader moammar gadhafi and ugandan president yoweri museveni attend the opening of the mosque . several of the guards to the visiting heads of state from kenya , tanzania , burundi , rwanda , mali , somalia , sudan and djibouti sustained serious injuries in the fight , which included punches , kicks and the drawing of guns . no leaders were hurt in the melee , though several were knocked over . several journalists also were caught up in the fracas and suffered injuries or lost their grips on cameras and recorders . the incident occurred at the opening of a massive gadhafi national mosque in kampala , a structure begun by the late ugandan dictator idi amin in 1972 and completed with financing from libya , according to african media reports . minutes after libyan leader moammar gadhafi and his host , ugandan president yoweri museveni , jointly unveiled a plaque to mark the event , the libyan guards pushed away the guards of other delegations at the mosque 's entrance . the ugandan guards -- who had traded hostilities with the predominantly-arab libyan guards at every joint event since gadhafi 's arrival in the country sunday -- reacted with fury and fought back . museveni briefly lost his balance when a hefty libyan guard pushed him to a wall . another libyan guard pushed rwandan president paul kagame , who also lost his balance but was caught by his own guards . the vice president of tanzania was knocked over by fighting guards as he was taking his shoes off to enter the mosque . guards to the rest of the visiting presidents and prime ministers kept their respective leaders out of the fray , with some drawing their guns as the dignitaries looked on in disbelief . some leaders -- notably those from somalia , burundi and djibouti -- were visibly uneasy as guns were drawn on all sides . by the time the fight was over more than six minutes later , about a dozen presidential guards were left bleeding from compound fractures and the libyan and ugandan protocol officials traded bitter accusations of disrespect and racism . `` what are your people up to ? do you want to kill our leader ? '' a libyan protocol official said to his ugandan counterpart . the ugandan official , who declined to be named , shouted back , `` why do think you 're superior ? what makes you think uganda has any ill intention against gadhafi ? '' the ugandan official said museveni 's guards were simply doing their job as security for the host country and had a right to respond when the libyan guards pushed them back . it has taken 36 years to complete the giant mosque on a hill in the heart of kampala . it used to be a colonial fort named after british capt. frederick lugard . the mosque can accommodate as many as 17,000 people at one time , according to the engineers , who call it the largest mosque in sub-saharan africa . many muslims interviewed said the mosque 's opening evoked sweet memories of amin , the deceased dictator . `` it is a great day and thanks be to allah for the completion , '' said salim abdul noor , 39 . `` this should remind us that while amin is demonized as africa 's worst dictator , there are many things he did for this country that successive governments largely depend on , and much of the completed installations and structures like this beautiful mosque was amin 's dream , may allah rest him in peace . '' the swedish vice president of the european islamic conference , adly abu hajar , 57 , said the mosque heals rifts in a religion introduced to uganda in 1844 by arab slave traders . `` i find this complex has brought unity among muslims in uganda . there have been so many factions , but this attraction has brought them together , identifying themselves with a common home . '' the fight prompted a crisis meeting by ugandan security authorities , after which invited diplomats from mainly the european missions in uganda expressed dismay . `` it 's disgrace . it shows there is something wrong yet unknown between the two parties , '' said the head of one european mission in kampala , who declined to be named . the police chief , maj. gen. kale kayihura , and the head of the army , gen. aronda nyakairima , declined to comment on the fight . but capt. edison kwesiga , the spokesman of the ugandan presidential guard brigade , confirmed their hostile relationship with the libyans . `` it is our responsibility to ensure the safety of any visiting head of state . we have to do our job using any means . but our libyan brothers always want us to fail . true , it 's not the first time they come and act as you see , '' kwesiga said . e-mail to a friend .

482	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. hillary clinton received the most votes in two pivotal democratic primary contests tuesday , scoring wins in texas and ohio that were considered critical to keeping alive her white house hopes . sen. hillary clinton is the winner in ohio and texas primaries , but trails in the texas caucuses . with 99 percent of precincts reporting in ohio , clinton had 54 percent of the vote compared to 44 percent for sen. barack obama . the race was closer in texas where , with 99 percent of precincts in , clinton had 51 percent to obama 's 48 percent . a complicated formula in texas that weighs delegates more heavily in highly populated areas and includes a caucus that was still being tallied wednesday afternoon meant the delegate count there remained unclear . obama was leading clinton in the caucus vote 56 percent to 44 percent with 38 percent of the state counted , party officials said . the party will split 67 delegates between the candidates in proportion to the final caucus results . watch an i-report video from a democratic caucus '' a final tally was not expected until thursday afternoon , officials said . regardless , the two wins were crucial for clinton , who would have found it difficult to continue the race if obama won big tuesday . `` for everyone across america who has been counted out but refused to be knocked out , for everyone who has stumbled but stood right back up and for everyone who works hard and never gives up , this one is for you , '' clinton said to a cheering crowd in columbus , ohio . watch clinton thank backers '' after a month of losses to obama , clinton had been expected to do well in ohio -- where the blue-collar workers who have consistently supported her throughout the campaign make up a large chunk of the democratic base . but with polls showing the ohio contest neck-and-neck in the days leading up to the primary , clinton got a boost from female voters and those who only recently made up their minds . according to cnn exit polling , 59 percent of the voters in the state 's democratic primary were women . those female voters favored clinton over obama , 58 percent to 40 percent . in the past week , clinton sharpened her attacks on obama -- questioning whether he has enough experience to lead the nation and attempting to cast doubt on his opposition to international trade agreements that many in ohio feel have led to job losses . poll results suggest it may have worked . among those polled , 64 percent of those who decided their vote in the last three days chose clinton . clinton was believed to need strong performances in tuesday 's contests in ohio and texas to halt obama 's momentum in the race and stay alive in the hunt for the 2,025 delegates needed to win the nomination . as early returns were counted tuesday , obama ran a string of consecutive victories to 12 with a lopsided win in vermont . with 99 percent of precincts reporting , he led clinton 59 percent to 39 percent . but clinton snapped that streak in rhode island . with 98 percent of precincts reporting , clinton had taken 58 percent of the vote to obama 's 40 percent . speaking in san antonio , texas , obama told supporters he expected to hold a similar delegate lead over clinton after tuesday 's races to the one he held before . `` we know this -- no matter what happens tonight , we have nearly the same delegate lead we had this morning and we are on the way to winning this nomination , '' he said to cheers and chants of his trademark phrase , `` yes we can . '' watch an excerpt of obama 's speech to supporters '' with texas ' delegates still to be awarded , clinton had picked up 22 delegates after results in ohio , rhode island and vermont were tallied . obama entered the day holding a lead of just over 100 delegates , with 1,369 pledged delegates and superdelegates to clinton 's 1,267 , according to cnn estimates . in ohio , harsh weather and balloting problems stretched the polling well into the evening . with polls slated to close at 7:30 p.m. , state elections officials decided to extend voting until 9 p.m. in northern ohio 's sandusky county . the area was hit by freezing rain for much of the day , and ballot shortages were reported in the cleveland and columbus areas -- also causing the polls to be open until 9 p.m. texas , with its 193 democratic delegates , and ohio , with 141 , were the biggest prizes in tuesday 's contests . there were 15 democratic delegates at stake in vermont and 21 in rhode island . ` texas two-step ' texas ' results may not be as easy to measure as counting votes . in what pundits have been calling the `` texas two-step , '' the state 's democratic party held a primary election , in which 126 delegates were awarded , and a post-election caucus in which another 67 are at stake . it 's possible for the loser of the primary to win more delegates with a strong showing in the caucuses . texas ' method of awarding delegates in the primary -- with more delegates coming from large population centers like houston , dallas and austin -- further complicates the matter . as polling places closed tuesday , texans reportedly lined up in bigger-than-expected numbers for the caucuses -- in some places lining up in parking lots and overflowing buildings where caucuses were held . party officials wednesday said 1.1 million voters participated in the caucuses . a cnn i-reporter in houston said there were hundreds of people at his polling place -- he said he waited more than an hour just to sign in . at an austin caucus , about 800 people showed up -- far outstripping expectations and causing organizers to stand on tables and yell to organize caucus-goers , one voter said . clinton supporters had said a strong performance would keep her campaign alive . weeks ago , former president clinton predicted his wife would need wins in texas and ohio to stay in the race . `` if hillary clinton gets out a small win in ohio and texas , it will be like punxsutawney phil seeing his shadow , '' said political adviser and clinton supporter paul begala , referring to the six more weeks of winter the groundhog is said to predict . the obama campaign , however , said the arithmetic of the delegate count will make it difficult for clinton to overcome obama 's lead . `` they 've had a really bad run and they have to rationalize continuing , '' said obama spokesman david axelrod . `` we 've won more popular votes and more delegates , and they have to give some rationale for staying in this race .

483	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- china 's giant pandas are believed to be safe after monday 's earthquake , but concern is growing over how they will get their next meals . questions remain about whether infrastructure damage will harm the giant pandas ' supply of bamboo . authorities confirmed tuesday that captive animals in two of china 's major panda reserves were alive , according to xinhua , china 's official news agency . the wolong giant panda reserve center in southwest sichuan province is home to about 86 giant pandas , who were reported safe tuesday . staff and critters at neighboring chengdu panda breeding and research center were also reported safe , according to a spokesperson for the atlanta zoo , which has two pandas on loan from the wildlife reserve . concern arose in the international wildlife community over damage to the animals ' habitat , as authorities continued assessing the scope of damage in the sichuan province . the mountainous , densely wooded region is the natural habitat for most of the 1,200 giant pandas living in the wild , making it an obvious location for research bases like wolong and chengdu . giant pandas roam the forest in `` open cages '' that are meant to provide them with a safe , natural environment that will prepare them for release . with the safety of the pandas confirmed , the animals ' caregivers are left to determine how resources like food and medical supplies will reach the bases , which contain breeding facilities and triage centers . bamboo , the pandas ' primary source of food , is a major agricultural product in the region , but whether it can be supplied to the pandas despite infrastructure damage is open to question . `` wolong is hard to access under normal conditions , so the heavy road damage makes it even harder , '' said kerry zobor , spokeswoman for the world wildlife fund . zobor said the wwf had confirmed the safety of staff members based in beijing but had not received word on the conditions in wolong . she said the wwf was also concerned about members who had been touring the country when the earthquake struck . the group has not been located . scientists in the united states are hopeful that chinese researchers will adapt to the situation facing them . david wildt with the smithsonian 's national zoological park in washington says scientists in wolong have overcome threats to the giant panda population before . in the late 1990s , the captive giant panda population was in decline , with more animals dying than were born , wildt said . thanks to a collaborative effort with american scientists , the wolong staff was able to reverse the trend . `` our chinese colleagues are very perceptive when it comes to addressing problems , '' said wildt , who has visited wolong many times as part of the smithsonian 's affiliation with the research base . `` because of their efforts , the population is on the rise today . '' wildt said that chinese scientists have also addressed the issue of alternative food sources . `` artificial diets in the form of protein biscuits have been created for giant pandas . they 're not a complete substitute , but they meet the needs of a basic high-fiber diet , '' said wildt , who has worked with two pandas that the smithsonian has on loan from wolong . `` right now , we 're mostly concerned about the staff . if the staff is fine , then the animals will be fine , '' wildt said .

486	belgrade , serbia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.s. embassy in belgrade is evacuating all nonessential personnel following thursday 's attack on the building by a crowd of protesters , a spokesman for the embassy told cnn friday . serbian riot police stand in front of the damaged u.s. embassy in belgrade on friday . the u.s. ambassador , cameron munter , is staying , officials said . the embassy was closed friday , and a handful of riot police holding shields stood outside the building , its outer walls blackened from fires set the night before and some of its windows smashed . it will remain closed until monday or tuesday so officials can assess the damage , said bill wanlund , the embassy 's spokesman . he said embassy staff were still in a heightened state of alert but there were no specific threats against any staff members . the united states has warned the serbian government that it has a responsibility to protect its assets . a top u.s. diplomat was asked during an interview on cnn if the serbian government `` gets '' the warning . `` they 'd better get it , because they have a fundamental responsibility to protect our diplomats and our embassy and to protect american citizens , '' said undersecretary of state for political affairs r. nicholas burns . `` what happened yesterday in belgrade was absolutely reprehensible . '' watch burns ' angry comments on belgrade attack '' thursday 's violence erupted after demonstrations by thousands of serbs against kosovo 's declaration of independence . the anger directed against the united states and other countries for recognizing the breakaway province as a nation sparked attacks on western embassies and shops by hundreds of people . burns said there was an `` insufficient '' number of security people guarding the u.s. embassy at a demonstration everyone knew would take place . he said security `` melted away '' as `` the mob attacked our embassy . '' `` this kind of thing should not happen in a civilized country . it does n't happen in the united states of america . it does n't happen in most world capitals . so the serb government needs to reflect seriously about the responsibility it has under the vienna convention , '' he said . burns , the third highest ranking diplomat in the state department , said he told the serbian prime minister , vojislav kostunica , and his government that the u.s. `` would hold them personally responsible for the safety of our people . '' `` they assured me that they would have adequate security on the ground today and for every day to come . we will hold them to that commitment , '' burns said . demonstrators only managed to break into one u.s. embassy building , which wanlund said was rarely used by staff . he said the protesters did n't manage to get any documents or embassy materials . only marines and security guards were present at the embassy when the angry mob of about 100 approached the walls . in addition to the u.s. embassy , the protesters attacked other western interests including the embassies of britain and germany , as well as a mcdonald 's restaurant and a nike shop . `` one might understand the emotion , but not the violence , and that 's what the serb government needs to remember , '' burns said . burns , who is stepping down in march , has long been involved in trying to resolve tensions in the former yugoslavia . the situation was complicated by sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence by serbia 's predominantly albanian region of kosovo . kosovo is revered historically by orthodox christian serbs but also is claimed as separate and distinct by its ethnic muslim albanians . the wisdom of recognizing kosovo independence has been questioned by many observers , who say the united states wo n't recognize other unilateral declarations of independence . some opponents of kosovo 's independence say recognition is a bad precedent if it 's unilateral and not done in a bilateral , diplomatic setting . they say it will give others the incentive to stage their own breakaway nations . burns said every situation has its unique set of circumstances , as does kosovo , which was the victim of ethnic cleansing policies by the slobodan milosevic regime in 1999 . nato troops fought serbia in an air war then and pushed serbian forces out of the region . since then kosovo has been run by the united nations and with security supplied by nato forces . e-mail to a friend .

488	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- u.s. border officers found a wire between two fences along the u.s.-mexican border that , when stretched taut , could have seriously harmed or even decapitated border patrol agents , congress was told wednesday . the wire was about 4 feet high when pulled tight , or about neck level for an agent on an atv , officials say . `` it was configured in a way so that , if it was pulled , it would take off the head of a border patrol agent riding in an open car , '' homeland security secretary michael chertoff said at a house budget hearing . the wire was discovered saturday when authorities monitoring a surveillance camera saw two people on the north side of the border east of the san ysidro port of entry , in the san diego sector . border patrol agents sent to the area found a thick metal wire tied to a secondary fence . the wire stretched across the border road and led into mexico through a hole in the primary fence , according to u.s. customs and border protection . when pulled tight , the wire would be about 4 feet high -- about neck level for an agent riding on an all-terrain vehicle , cbp said . officials said they suspected that drug or illegal immigrant smugglers were involved . no arrests were made on either side of the border . the wire was removed , and no injuries or damage took place , cbp said . e-mail to a friend .

'' sen. barack obama and his wife , michelle , celebrate his south carolina win . the illinois senator earned more than twice the vote that rival sen. hillary clinton did , 55 percent to 27 percent , unofficial returns showed . former sen. john edwards was third with 18 percent . `` tonight , the cynics who believed that what began in the snows of iowa was just an illusion were told a different story by the good people of south carolina , '' obama said to supporters saturday . watch a recap of obama 's big win '' a win in south carolina was considered crucial for obama , who won iowa but finished second to clinton in new hampshire and nevada . see what the results mean '' `` i did not travel around this state over the last year and see a white south carolina or a black south carolina . i saw south carolina , '' he said . `` the choice in this election is not between regions or religions or genders , '' obama said . `` it 's not about rich versus poor ; young versus old ; and it is not about black versus white . `` it 's about the past versus the future . '' watch obama speech . with 99 percent of precincts reporting , obama had 55 percent of the vote . clinton was second with 27 percent , followed by edwards , with 18 percent . obama 's victory capped a heated contest in south carolina , the first democratic primary in the south and the first with a largely african-american electorate . obama , who is hoping to become the the nation 's first african-american president , did well with black voters , who made up about half of saturday 's electorate , according to exit polls . black voters supported the illinois senator by a margin of more than 4-to-1 over his nearest rival , exit polls indicate . among white voters , obama took about a quarter of the vote , with clinton and edwards roughly splitting the remainder , according to exit polls . clinton congratulated obama and said she was excited to move forward to the super tuesday contests on february 5 . `` millions and millions of americans are going to have the chance to have their voices heard and their votes counted , '' she told supporters at tennessee state university . watch clinton speak to supporters '' edwards also looked ahead to the next contests . `` now the three of us move on to february 5 , where millions of americans will cast their vote and help shape the future of this party and help shape the future of america , '' he said . watch edwards rally supporters '' `` our campaign from the very beginning has been about one central thing , and that is to give voice to the millions of americans who have absolutely no voice in this democracy .

'' on january 15 , edwards pledged , `` i 'm in this for the long haul . we 're continuing to accumulate delegates . there 's actually a very narrow margin between sen. obama , sen. clinton and myself on delegates . '' the state democratic party estimated that more than 530,000 democrats turned out for saturday 's primary , as compared with 445,000 voters who showed up to vote last weekend in the state 's republican primary . the democratic numbers topped the gop turnout for the first time since 1992 , when 445,000 republicans turned out to renominate president george h.w. bush . obama attracted more than 290,000 votes -- nearly matching the total turnout of the 2004 democratic primary . `` this is an enormous turnout , '' cnn analyst jeffrey toobin said . `` democrats are wildly motivated in this election . '' as south carolina 's democratic primary voters went to the polls saturday , almost half of them had made up their minds more than a month ago , according to exit polls . in the 2004 primary , nearly a quarter decided either the day of the primary or in the three days prior who they would support , but this year , only 10 percent of this year 's voters waited until saturday to choose . another 10 percent decided only in the last three days , and 32 percent decided in the last month . forty-seven percent made up their minds at least a month ago , more than double the percentage of 2004 . the early exit polls were taken from a sampling of 1,269 voters statewide . following a rough campaign between clinton and obama , the two camps toned down the rhetoric in the past two days , returning to the issues and concentrating their firepower on the republicans rather than on each other . `` i think they -lsb- the republicans -rsb- should be gracious and just say , `` we have messed this thing up so much we are just going to quit and ... we should n't be re-elected , ' but i do n't think that is what they are going to do , '' clinton said . south carolina is the last big test for the democrats before super tuesday , february 5 , when nearly two dozen states will hold either primaries or caucuses -- including such delegate-rich states as california , new york , new jersey and illinois . florida holds its primary on tuesday but no democratic delegates are being awarded there because the national party is penalizing the state for moving its primary up earlier in the year . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's paul steinhauser , bill schneider , peter hamby , alexander mooney , suzanne malveaux and jessica yellin contributed to this report .
490	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- handsome , articulate and lightning fast -- mclaren 's lewis hamilton can now add two more words to his list of qualities : very rich . lewis hamilton will be able to afford a lot more champagne in the future . the briton is set to become one of the most marketable sport stars in the world -- perhaps second only to tiger woods -- and earn more than a billion dollars if he can maintain the buzz created by his first season in formula one , experts say . on sunday he started his second season in perfect fashion , easily winning the australian grand prix in melbourne . the 23-year-old signed a five-year contract with mclaren worth an estimated $ 140m in january . it leaves him lagging along way behind ferrari 's kimi raikkonen , who is paid an estimated $ 50m a year for driving , but it is through endorsements that he stands to reap a greater windfall . stephen cheliotis , chief executive of the centre for brand analysis and uk superbrands and coolbrands councils ' chairman , said hamilton was the most marketable driver because he was a breath of fresh air . he had helped drive up race attendance and television fewer figures dramatically in his first season . `` he is young , mixing with the right people everyday -- rappers , film stars -- and a lot more articulate than kimi raikkonen , '' cheliotis said . `` he is also the first black driver and it does have a bearing , much like tiger woods in golf . he is also the most marketable because he is going to be the best , much like michael schumacher . '' pippa collett , sponsorship consulting 's managing director , said hamilton was certainly the most marketable driver in the short term . his performance meant he was the dominant member of a group of `` young turks '' -- nelson piquet jr , nico rosberg , heikki kovalainen -- who had great potential . collett said in terms of the media hamilton 's performance , friendliness , english speaking background and professionalism were key assets . if he could maintain these he would earn more than schumacher -- the sport 's first billionaire driver . indeed , schumacher set an example which hamilton would be wise to follow . he was the first driver to win personal sponsors after ferrari allowed him to sign a $ 10m annual deal with a german bank to place its logo on his cap . the german also actively pursued the development of his own retail range , which included caps -- he sold hundreds of thousands at $ 30 a pop -- and even a branded vacuum cleaner . collett said schumacher 's manager , willi weber , was very good . `` schumacher was a nice guy but not very charming . however , he was very professional and you knew he would turn up , '' collett said . cheliotis agreed hamilton would earn considerably more than schumacher , and that there would be a big gap between his earnings and that of the other drivers . however , there were pitfalls . lewis had already made the mistake of saying he was moving to switzerland to avoid the limelight when it was all about avoiding tax , cheliotis said . `` he said that and then turned up at every awards night for a month . '' cheliotis said appearing arrogant , being caught out by the tabloid press , endorsing a brand and then using another and over selling himself could also damage his value . `` the big danger with someone like hamilton is that he is so in demand and that he has so many sponsors it leads to brand confusion . there is a danger of being one of 50 sponsors and not getting any value . '' collett said hamilton needed to develop his `` life-time brand '' . while raikkonen may not be a media darling he had developed an `` iceman '' image , which was just as important in the long term . english footballer david beckham , whose performance had dropped off , had successfully developed a life-time brand that would out last his playing career . collett said hamilton 's one weakness may be his father , anthony . `` his dad is his manager . your brand positioning is as an individual ... having your dad around too much could affect your brand . '' collett said hamilton would have to be wary of bad press , but a little bit of young turk behaviour could enhance his image as long as he continued to excel . `` i think that is part of the glamour ... some of that and continued brilliant performances will make his life very easy .

491	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the federal government has released to cnn more than 100 photographs of a halloween party that temporarily threatened to derail the nomination of a top department of homeland security official . ice chief julie myers poses with a costume contest winner at the immigration and customs enforcement party . the images included several digital photos that the official had ordered erased because they were deemed to be inappropriate and offensive . at the party , julie myers , then-acting chief of immigration and customs enforcement -lrb- ice -rrb- , part of the department of homeland security , gave an award for `` most original costume '' to an employee wearing prison stripes , a wig with dreadlocks and face-darkening makeup . immediately after posing for a photo with the winner , myers later told congress , she recognized that she made an error in judgment and ordered the photos deleted from the camera . myers said she did not know the employee was wearing skin makeup , but ordered the photos destroyed because she did not think that `` recognizing an escaped prisoner in any way was beneficial to the agency 's goal of treating everyone in our custody with dignity and respect . '' this week , in response to the freedom of information act request filed by cnn on november 6 , ice released 113 official photographs of the party , including all of the deleted photos , which technicians were able to electronically restore . an ice spokeswoman denied the photos were suppressed until after myers ' job was secure , saying ice responded in an `` efficient time frame '' to the foia request . news of the photos ' existence infuriated some members of congress , who said they should have been made aware of them earlier . `` it is too bad that these photos surfaced too late to have dealt with her nomination , perhaps , in a different way , '' said sen. claire mccaskill , d-missouri , who last november put a `` hold '' on myers ' confirmation because of the hubbub . watch what congressmen think about party photos '' myers was confirmed on december 20 . as an assistant secretary of homeland security , she leads ice , the agency charged with enforcing immigration law in the nation 's interior . the agency has more than 15,000 employees , including 6,000 investigators . mccaskill said she believed the photos would have affected the confirmation . `` this is such brutally bad judgment that , to me , it indicates that the leadership of this division is flawed , '' she said . rep. bennie thompson , whose committee oversees ice , said wednesday he is upset both by the photos and by ice 's failure to give the photos to congress in november . `` i was satisfied -lsb- with myers ' explanations and apology -rsb- until i found out that these pictures existed , '' thompson said . an ice spokeswoman denied that there was any intentional effort to mislead congress . `` we had asked that they be destroyed , and as far as we knew , that was the case , '' spokeswoman kelly nantel said . myers was `` frank and honest about every aspect of that situation from the very beginning , '' she said . an estimated 50 to 75 employees attended the october 31 costume party at ice headquarters in the district of columbia . a poster advertising the contest said costumes should be tasteful and `` office appropriate . '' myers declined to talk to cnn wednesday , but in written comments to congress last november , she offered the following account of the incident : . she and two other ice officials served as judges of the costume contest , and she had `` very limited interaction '' with the employee in the prisoner costume , who `` was present at the -lsb- judging -rsb- table for less than half a minute before he moved on . `` i was not aware at the time of the contest that the employee disguised his skin color , '' she wrote . nonetheless , after posing for a photo with the employee , she realized it was inappropriate . `` although i did not know that this individual had disguised his race , i determined that i had made an error in judgment in recognizing an escaped prisoner at this party , '' she wrote , and she instructed her chief of staff to direct the official photographer to delete the photos . in an internal e-mail that was sent at 3:05 p.m. , shortly after the party was to end , the ice public affairs director , wendy burrell , said , `` please make sure that the photos of the most creative -lrb- single male entry -rrb- are destroyed . they may not be used in any publication , web site , compilation disk , you name it . not just not used . please erase all . '' myers said she was `` shocked and horrified '' to learn the next day that the employee had used skin-darkening makeup . the employee was counseled , and myers sent out a note to all agency employees expressing regret over the event , agency spokeswoman kelly nantel said in november . `` it is now clear that , however unintended , a few of the costumes were inappropriate and offensive , '' myers wrote . she reminded employees of their responsibility to complete diversity training and said managers should distribute and discuss ice 's diversity policy statement during staff meetings . the employee who donned the inmate costume was placed on two weeks of administrative leave , counseled by a supervisor and returned to full duty . e-mail to a friend .

493	baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the office of muqtada al-sadr accused iraqi and u.s. forces of attacking sadr city on friday , just hours after the shiite cleric called for calm in the wake of the assassination of one of his top aides in the southern city of najaf . iraqi sadrists march friday in the najaf funeral procession of sayyed riyadh al-nuri , top aide to muqtada al-sadr . witnesses and media in the heavily shiite baghdad neighborhood of sadr city , home to the cleric 's power base in the capital , reported heavy fighting between u.s.-backed iraqi troops and al-sadr 's mehdi army militia . the witnesses said u.s. aircraft had been bombarding the area for hours , and media reported rockets slamming into houses and many casualties . witnesses and al-sadr 's office said mosques were making loudspeaker announcements about mehdi army attacks on u.s. military armored vehicles . u.s. troops working in support of iraqi soldiers killed two snipers , two other men firing rocket-propelled grenades and `` multiple others from a nearby building where soldiers were taking rpg and machine gun fire , '' the u.s. military said in a statement . at the same time -- about 9 p.m. -- at least six roadside bombs damaged vehicles in a u.s. army convoy that was transporting barriers for a group of iraqi army soldiers establishing a checkpoint , the military said . afterward , the military said , the iraqi and u.s. soldiers were attacked by small-arms , machine-gun and rpg fire from buildings overlooking the road . the soldiers fired back at their attackers , killing at least four of them . more explosions from the buildings indicated possible arms and munitions stored there , the military said . but the small-arms attack continued until the u.s. forces fired two rounds from an m1a2 abrams tank , killing two more attackers . not long afterward , the u.s. air force , operating an unmanned aerial vehicle , fired a hellfire missile at three men spotted setting roadside bombs , killing all three . maj. john gossart , executive officer of the american unit involved , said that no u.s. or iraqi troops were seriously hurt . earlier , al-sadr issued remarks about the killing of sayyed riyadh al-nuri , who was shot outside his house in najaf 's adala neighborhood after returning from friday prayers . `` the hands of the occupiers and their collaborators have treacherously reached our beloved martyr sayyed riyadh al-nuri , '' al-sadr wrote in a statement on the web . al-nuri is one of 17 people killed over 24 hours in airstrikes , fighting and attacks in areas wracked in recent weeks by fighting among shiites . the assassination prompted an immediate vehicle ban in the shiite holy city of najaf , anger among mourners and an intensification of fighting in baghdad 's sadr city neighborhood . iraqi prime minister nuri al-maliki issued a statement deploring the killing and ordering an investigation . al-sadr issued remarks about the killing in a statement on a web site . spokesman sheikh salah al-obeidi emphasized that the cleric is not accusing anyone in particular of the killing but believes that the killers `` are the ones who are following the occupiers ' steps and do n't want stability for the country . '' but al-obeidi called the killing an `` act of provocation '' after the `` siege of sadr city . '' he was referring to the battles since sunday involving members of al-sadr 's mehdi army militia and iraqi security forces dominated by a rival shiite political movement , the islamic supreme council of iraq . that fighting started with an offensive in basra and spread to other shiite regions , including sadr city and the babil provincial capital of hilla . the al-nuri assassination prompted officials to expand the daily curfew in hilla . police said a ban on all outside movement that usually begins at 11 p.m. and ends at 8 a.m. will instead start at 8:30 p.m. violence continued friday in several places in iraq . suicide bombings killed at least four people -- three of them police -- and wounded 15 , officials said . the first bombing was in ramadi , the provincial capital of the predominantly sunni anbar province west of baghdad , an interior ministry official said . at least three national police officers were killed and five wounded , the official said . the second attack took place at a checkpoint about 20 km -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- north of baiji , according to police , who said the bomber and one other person were killed and 10 were wounded . the casualties were members of a local awakening council who were manning the checkpoint , police said . the suicide bomber was driving a pickup carrying sheep . awakening councils , or sons of iraq , are made up of sunnis who have turned on al qaeda in iraq . also , at least three people were killed and five wounded in a mortar attack on baghdad 's palestine hotel , an interior ministry official said . the palestine hotel -- across the tigris river from the international zone , the heavily guarded seat of u.s. power in baghdad -- is in the path of many of the rockets and mortars aimed at the zone . the u.s. military has blamed iranian-backed shiite militants for recent mortar and rocket attacks in baghdad and international zone , also known as the green zone . unmanned aerial vehicles targeted and killed six suspected insurgents in basra on friday and six `` heavily armed criminals '' in northeastern baghdad on thursday night , the u.s. military said . watch the baghdad drone attack '' the u.s. and iraqi militaries have consistently said they have not been targeting specific groups in their recent battles in shiite areas . iraqi and u.s. government officials say they differentiate between mehdi army members obeying al-sadr 's seven-month cease-fire pledge and `` gangs , '' `` criminals '' or `` outlaws '' who are n't obeying al-sadr 's orders . the intra-shiite fighting in iraq that has killed hundreds of people in the past two weeks has involved two main movements : members of the mehdi army militia loyal to al-sadr , and iraqi security forces dominated by the chief political rival of the sadrists , the islamic supreme council of iraq . many of those security forces had been integrated into police and army units from the council 's badr brigade militia . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's yousif bassil and jomana karadsheh contributed to this report .

'' the red cross board of governors asked for and received everson 's resignation after it `` concluded that the situation reflected poor judgment on mr. everson 's part and diminished his ability to lead the organization in the future , '' the red cross said in a statement on its web site . everson , 53 , said in a written statement that he was leaving the $ 500,000-per-year job `` for personal and family reasons , and deeply regret it is impossible for me to continue in a job so recently undertaken .

'' the board of governors on tuesday appointed mary s. elcano , general counsel and five-year red cross employee , as interim president and ceo . everson had worked in the bush administration from august 2001 -- including serving as commissioner of the internal revenue service -- until he was hired by the red cross . `` this is flabbergasting , that 's all i can say . it 's completely contrary to his public persona that he evidenced while he was at the irs , '' said suzanne ross mcdowell , a washington-based attorney who served on an advisory committee to the irs division that deals with tax-exempt organizations . `` from the standpoint of exempt organizations on the non-profit sector , it 's just another news story that we would rather not see , '' she said . `` it 's got nothing to do with the red cross , '' said ira milstein , a new york lawyer specializing in corporate governance who has worked with the organization and was impressed with everson . `` he was a team player and a good leader . to have him fall off a cliff like this is just sad . '' a search committee has been formed to begin the process of finding everson 's permanent replacement , the organization said . the job has been a challenging one . marsha j. evans resigned as president in 2005 , after the red cross response to hurricane katrina came under fire . four years earlier , bernadine healy quit the post after the organization was criticized for mishandling donations intended for victims of the september 11 terrorist attacks and collecting vast quantities of blood that was not needed and ultimately thrown out . healy told reporters she `` had no choice '' about her resignation . meanwhile , defrancis acknowledged tuesday that , 14 years after a court ordered the agency to improve its collection of blood , it has yet to meet federal safety and quality-control requirements . e-mail to a friend .

498	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the taliban in afghanistan -- whose government was toppled by u.s.-led forces after the september 11 attacks in 2001 -- has strengthened its military and technical capabilities even while suffering heavy combat losses , says a state department report released wednesday . afghan policemen stand wednesday outside the ruins of a house destroyed during clashes with taliban insurgents . `` the taliban-led insurgency remained a capable , determined , and resilient threat to stability and to the expansion of government authority , particularly in the pashtun south and east , '' according to the `` country reports on terrorism 2007 . '' the taliban 's information operations have become `` increasingly aggressive and sophisticated , '' and their ability to obtain al qaeda support and recruit soldiers from the taliban base of rural pashtuns is `` undiminished , '' the report says . but new civilian-military counterinsurgency approaches in the east , particularly nangarhar , have begun to yield successes , the report says . the taliban is funding its terror activities with money from supporters in neighboring pakistan and from narcotics trafficking and kidnappings . kidnappings of foreigners have increased , the report says . the group also has increased its use of improvised explosive devices , and suicide bombings have become more frequent and more deadly , it says . quoting u.n.-compiled figures , the state department said terrorists launched about 140 suicide-bomb attacks in 2007 . the number of terror attacks in afghanistan increased from 969 in 2006 to 1,127 last year , and the number of people killed , injured or kidnapped as the result of terrorism rose from 3,557 in 2006 to 4,673 in 2007 , the report says . in the face of attacks by the taliban and related groups on coalition forces and others , afghanistan has struggled to build a stable , democratic government . however , it has taken steps to build strong relationships with neighboring pakistan and address problems such as poverty that help fuel terrorism , the report says . the program for strengthening peace and reconciliation has persuaded more than 5,000 taliban members and other insurgents to stop their lives of violence , it says . the shifting situation in afghanistan prompted the top u.s. military officer to say in early april that he is `` deeply concerned '' about the situation there , and that maintaining troops in iraq is harming overall u.s. military capabilities . `` the taliban is growing bolder , suicide attacks are on the rise , and so is the trade in illegal narcotics , '' said adm. mike mullen , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff . u.s. defense secretary robert gates said the united states needs more troops to hold areas of southern afghanistan -- the region of highest concern -- and to train local army and police personnel . the two men testified before the senate armed services committee . the united states recently sent an additional 3,500 troops to afghanistan , but commanders in the region would like 10,000 to 12,000 more , gates said . he said he doubted nato would make up the difference . although 25 nato allies and 13 other countries have contributed forces , the bulk of the recent fighting in afghanistan has been done by u.s. , canadian , british and dutch troops . canadian troops are based in the southern province of kandahar , once a taliban stronghold . e-mail to a friend .
