750	yusufiya , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- female suicide bombers , who often slip through security checkpoints untouched because of cultural norms , are taking a more deadly toll than ever across iraq . a female suicide bomber struck northeast of baghdad on sunday , killing 16 . but the u.s. army has created a solution with `` daughters of iraq , '' a program that trains iraqi women to find female suicide bombers . women carried out eight bombings in all of 2007 , according to the u.s. military . halfway through 2008 , the number of female suicide bombers is 20 . a suicide attack carried out by a woman on sunday in baquba killed at least 16 people and wounded another 40 . `` daughters of iraq '' is a spinoff of `` sons of iraq , '' which employs iraqi men to run checkpoints and is credited with taking much of the steam out of the insurgency . the goal of the women 's program is twofold : to protect against female suicide bombers , and to provide much-needed income to iraqi women with few chances for employment . in the town of yusufiya , southwest of baghdad , some 30 women are being trained to search other females at security checkpoints -- something men are forbidden to do under iraqi cultural norms . in mid-may , a female suicide bomber killed an iraqi army officer in this town . `` when he came out to meet her to help her with a problem she was having , she detonated the vest and killed him and injured some of his soldiers , '' said michael starz , a u.s. army captain . the women will work two or three days a month , making up to $ 300 , an iraqi military officer explained to applicants . in a community , where families struggle to survive , that 's good money . watch how `` daughters of iraq '' works '' the women come from small farming communities . many of them are widows with numerous children and almost no income . such is the story of fawzia , who has six children to support . her husband was shot to death when his car broke down . `` i am ready -lrb- to work -rrb- as long as it helps me financially , '' she said . `` i have five children in school . '' having women work in this tradition-bound society is a social revolution , according to fatima , a volunteer leader , told cnn 's jill dougherty . `` many women would like to do it but their parents would not agree because it 's a rural society and it 's shameful for girls to go outside the home .

751	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the first pictures from nasa 's mars phoenix lander , which successfully touched down near mars ' north pole sunday , showed a pattern of brown polygons as far as the camera could see . the mars phoenix lander took this image of the planet 's surface at its landing site sunday . `` it 's surprisingly close to what we expected and that 's what surprises me most , '' said peter smith , the mission 's principal investigator . `` i expected a bigger surprise . '' the landing on the red planet 's arctic plains -- which ended a 296-day journey -- was right on target , a feat nasa 's ed weiler compared to landing a hole-in-one with a golf ball from 10,000 miles . the landing -- dubbed the `` seven minutes of terror '' -- was a nerve-wracking experience for mission managers , who have witnessed the failure of similar missions . in mission control at nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena , california , they celebrated the lander 's much-anticipated entry . `` it was better than we could have imagined , '' barry goldstein , project manager for the phoenix mission , told cnn . watch the celebration at mission control '' the phoenix 's 90-day mission is to analyze the soils and permafrost of mars ' arctic tundra for signs of past or present life . the lander is equipped with a robotic arm capable of scooping up ice and dirt to look for organic evidence that life once existed there , or even exists now . `` we are not going to be able to answer the final question of is there life on mars , '' said principal investigator peter smith , an optical scientist with the university of arizona . `` we will take the next important step . we 'll find out if there 's organic material associated with this ice in the polar regions . ice is a preserver , and if there ever were organics on mars and they got into that ice , they will still be there today . '' the twin to the mars polar lander spacecraft , phoenix was supposed to travel to mars in 2001 as the mars surveyor spacecraft . they were originally part of the `` better , faster , cheaper '' program , formulated by then-nasa administrator dan goldin to beef up planetary exploration on a lean budget . but polar malfunctioned during its descent into mars ' atmosphere in 1999 and crashed . an investigation concluded that as many as a dozen design flaws or malfunctions doomed the spacecraft . the failure of that mission , as well as another spacecraft called the mars climate orbiter the same year , led to nasa to put future missions on hold and rethink the `` better , faster , cheaper '' approach . mars surveyor went to the warehouse . watch the challenges the mission faced '' but all was not lost . in 2003 , smith proposed a plan to re-engineer the mars surveyor and fly it on a mission to look for signatures of life in the ice and dirt of mars far north . mars phoenix , literally and figuratively , rose from the ashes of surveyor . engineers set to work , testing and retesting the onboard system to ferret out and fix all the flaws they could find . ireport.com : send your photos , video of space . `` we always have to be scared to death , '' goldstein said . `` the minute we lose fear is the minute that we stop looking for the next problem . '' the team was concerned about the phoenix landing system . nasa had not successfully landed a probe on mars using landing legs and stabilizing thrusters since the viking missions in the late 1970s . the other three successful mars landings -- pathfinder in 1997 and the spirit and opportunity rovers in 2004 -- used massive airbags that inflated around the landing craft just before landing to cushion the impact . learn about nasa 's past missions to mars '' the phoenix does n't have airbags because the lander is too big and heavy for them to work properly . its landing site was targeted for the far northern plains of mars , near the northern polar ice cap . data from the mars odyssey spacecraft indicate large quantities of ice there , likely in the form of permafrost , either on the surface or just barely underground . `` follow the water '' has become the unifying theme of nasa 's mars exploration strategy . in 2004 , the rover opportunity found evidence that a salty sea once lapped the shores of an area near mars ' equator called meridiani planum . astrobiologists generally agree that it 's best to look for life in wet places . cnn 's kate tobin contributed to this report .

753	harare , zimbabwe -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- with polls closed for a zimbabwe runoff that opposition politicians and international observers call a sham , alleged torture victims who support former candidate morgan tsvangirai said friday that they back his decision to pull out of the race . many of the injured being treated at a private hospital in harare , zimbabwe , asked not to be identified . `` it 's a good move by my president , morgan tsvangirai , '' said a 26-year-old movement for democratic change activist who said he was forced to stand on hot coals and had boiling water poured on him about a week ago . `` there 's no use going for an election . '' the man , who displayed a large , pale , blistered patch on his back , asked not to be identified -- as did others being treated at a private hospital in harare -- for fear of further attacks by gangs supportive of president robert mugabe . all of the victims said they were taken to `` torture bases '' by the gangs , made up of young men and soldiers . in the march 29 election , mdc officials said their polling showed tsvangirai clearly defeating mugabe , who at 84 is the only president zimbabwe has had since it gained independence from britain in 1980 . but after delaying the release of results for more than a week , the country 's electoral commission -- which is made up of mugabe appointees -- said that although tsvangirai got more votes , he did n't top the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff . mdc supporters had already reported violence against them by police , military members and other supporters of mugabe 's zanu-pf party . but in the weeks leading up to the runoff , the reports increased in frequency and intensity . more than 70 people were killed in attacks since the election , according to the mdc . mugabe 's supporters have claimed that those attacks were against his party members , a claim international observers , including the united nations , have disputed . watch victims say they were taken to torture camps '' tsvangirai and other party leaders were repeatedly arrested by police or detained on their way to political rallies . and reports of beatings and other intimidation tactics were common in areas where the mdc had made strong showings in the election . `` mostly for the rural people -- the police would come in for the zanu-pf , so the area was very tense , '' said a municipal worker at the hospital , who said he was kicked and had burning plastic poured on his skin about three or four days ago . `` everyone was beaten . whether zanu-pf or mdc . there was chaos in the country . '' george charamba , a spokesman for mugabe , insisted that the vote was `` free and fair . '' charamba denied that any pressure was being used . asked about images from zimbabwe showing what is reported to be violence against members of the opposition , he responded , `` i thought we are long past the age where we could consider pictures as not lying . it 's very , very easy for anyone to stage-manage a demonstration , and a violent one at that . '' last weekend , tsvangirai withdrew from the runoff , saying there was no way the result would be legitimate . he has spent much of the time since living in the dutch embassy in harare in fear for his safety . early friday , the municipal worker said he was considering whether to heed tsvangirai 's call for his supporters to not vote in the election , but the question may be moot . the gangs took his identification card and threw it into a fire , he said . another man and a woman treated for broken hands at the hospital said they were tortured and had boiling water poured on their genitals for being mdc supporters . the man said he was forced to drink sewage . meanwhile , mugabe laughed and mugged for reporters from zimbabwe 's state-run media as he cast his ballot at a high school . `` very optimistic , upbeat ... and hungry , '' he said when asked how he was feeling .
754	editor 's note : saturday marks one year since hamas ' defeat of fatah in the fierce struggle for control of gaza . cnn correspondent ben wedeman has been covering the region for over 15 years . he reports from gaza on daily life and reality over the past year in this fractious land . cnn 's ben wedeman reports on the past year in gaza , where people are safer but out of food , gas , and patience . gaza city , gaza -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- `` if you take pictures , i 'll kill you ! i 'll kill you ! '' screamed a masked fatah gunman , pointing his ak-47 assault rifle at my cameraman , joe duran . `` calm down ! calm down ! '' i shouted back at him , turning to joe to tell him to put the camera down . joe and i had ducked into a fruit and vegetable shop in gaza city . we had been covering the funeral of a fatah gunman killed in a clash with hamas rivals when our third gunbattle of the day had broken out . the gunman left , much to everyone 's relief , and i put my small video camera on the floor and pressed the button to record the constant roar of machine gun fire , which went on for more than half an hour . earlier in the day , joe and i were on a street corner videotaping hamas militiamen when a jeep full of fatah irregulars opened fire , just down the street from an elementary school . as guns blazed , schoolchildren ran for cover . i watched as shopkeeper khadar aliyan slammed shut the doors of his grocery store , the expression on his face one of fear and utter exasperation . `` i 'm going home , '' he told me . `` i 'm afraid . we 're done for . it 's never been this bad . '' it was violence like this , which we witnessed on december 2006 , that reached a climax in the second week of june 2007 . when it ended on june 14 , 2007 , with hamas roundly defeating fatah , gaza went quiet . and quiet -- relative quiet , that is -- has been hamas ' biggest accomplishment since . no longer do you worry about being kidnapped . gunbattles , though they can happen , are much less common . after last june 's takeover -lrb- or coup d'etat , as fatah supporters call it -rrb- , hamas quickly imposed law and order , tried to reacquaint gaza 's drivers with long-forgotten traffic regulations , launched a municipal cleanup campaign , and forced the release of kidnapped bbc journalist alan johnston , who had been held in captivity for almost six months . chaos-weary gazans applauded all of these initiatives . but the honeymoon ended quickly as reality sank in . since hamas won parliamentary elections in january 2006 , and even more so since last year 's takeover , israel has tightened its siege of gaza . israel has restricted supplies of gasoline , diesel and electricity to gaza , limited the amount of food and other goods entering the strip , and made it virtually impossible for manufacturers and farmers in gaza to export anything to the outside world . israeli officials say these measures are intended to pressure hamas , which is on the u.s. government list of terrorist groups , to stop its members and other factions from firing mortars and rockets into israel . israel defense forces reports that 1,500 qassam rockets were fired into israel from gaza in 2007 , and 2,383 in the past six years . as a result , almost all of gaza 's factories have shut down and thousands of workers have lost their jobs . between 70 and 80 percent of the population is dependent on food supplied by the united nations refugee works agency , set up after more than 700,000 palestinians became refugees after the war that resulted in israel 's creation in 1948 . life in gaza , never easy , in the last year has become a grinding daily struggle to make ends meet . for the vast majority of gazans , it means they must spend much of their time trying to secure basic commodities . such as cooking gas , which comes from israel . in the past , when supplies were plentiful , it was sold from the back of trucks and donkey carts . not anymore . when there are supplies , people flock to a few distribution centers . one is a hot , crowded compound north of gaza city , where the stench of gas is so strong you shudder with fear that someone will light a cigarette and the whole place will go up in flames . people have to wait for their cooking gas for hours some claim days , in the hot sun . there i met a woman who identified herself as um wadi'a -lrb- the mother of wadi'a -rrb- , who at 2 p.m. told me she had been waiting since 5 a.m. . she said she had run out of cooking gas three days before . typical of so many people here , she blamed both main palestinian factions for her woes . `` hamas has n't done anything for us , nor has fatah , '' she said . `` all those people want is to sit comfortably on their thrones . '' in gaza city , long lines of immobile cars and trucks wind around the block from gas stations , their owners waiting , surprisingly patiently , for supplies to arrive . the only other option is to go in search of black market gasoline , much of it smuggled through tunnels from egypt . it goes for more than $ 10 a liter , which comes close to almost $ 50 a gallon . it is now common for families to divide up responsibilities for the day . one family member will go in search of cooking gas , another will join the line for gasoline or diesel , another for whatever else is in short supply . to get around the shortages , some motorists mix their fuel with cooking oil , a practice that is n't particularly good for the motor . many people complain that it 's unhealthy -- but it works . others , like electrical engineer wasim khazandar , are thinking completely outside the box . wasim has invented an electric car , which he is more than happy to show off . he 's already received dozens of orders from motorists weary of the search for fuel . beyond material concerns , there are worries here that hamas has a barely concealed hardline islamist agenda , and one often hears complaints that the group is intolerant of any form of dissent or criticism . one man who can testify to that is ibrahim abu al-naja , the most senior fatah leader to remain in gaza after most fled to safety in ramallah . abu al-naja is from the fatah old school , a grizzled veteran of the group 's wars in lebanon . he told me earlier this year hamas security officials showed up at his home late at night , bound his hands , put a blindfold on him and dragged him to their headquarters , where they shaved his head and cut off his moustache , then released him without apology or explanation . he makes no excuses for fatah 's dismal track record of corruption and mismanagement when it ran gaza , but says the crisis that began with hamas ' rise to power is nothing short of a catastrophe . `` our people has been transformed , '' he said , `` into a desperate people , who must search for food , for the minimum of survival . it 's as if we returned to 1948 , dependent on gifts and assistance and relief . '' despite all the difficulties of life under hamas , despite all the grumbling , the men who run gaza are as confident today as they were a year ago that they will weather the crisis and emerge stronger . last wednesday i went to see ahmed yusif , a senior adviser to hamas prime minister ismail haniya . `` whatever the israelis think , '' said the u.s.-educated yusif , `` whatever pressure they put on us , it 's not going to make us buckle or give concessions . `` this is part of the palestinian struggle for more than 60 years living in the refugee camps , '' he said . `` we do n't always enjoy a good life . it 's the toughness and the suffering -lsb- that -rsb- are part of the struggle . '' others here do n't quite see it that way , like a man i met in gaza 's old market who would only identify himself as abu khalid . i asked him if he was better off today than a year ago . he laughed , cursed israel , hamas , fatah , the united states , the european union and the rest of the world , then made the following suggestion : `` let them open a market in gaza so we can sell some of our children -lsb- in order to -rsb- feed the rest .

757	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the bush administration hailed north korea 's declaration of its nuclear program as a success for the multilateral diplomacy it engaged in through the six party talks with south korea , china , japan and russia . workers remove fuel rods on the reactor floor at north korea 's yongbyon nuclear facility this year . in fact , north korea 's confessions of many of its nuclear sins -- and its shutdown of its nuclear reactor at yongbyon -- are the closest the international community has come to curbing north korea 's nuclear program . as a result of pyongyang 's handover of the 60-page declaration document -- and friday 's expected destruction of the cooling tower at yongbyon -- president bush ordered some sanctions against north korea lifted and instructed the state department to remove the reclusive communist nation from u.s. lists of enemies and nations that support terrorism . but as important as what the document says is what it does n't say . there is no mention of how many weapons north korea has or where they are hidden . nor did north korea admit to a suspected uranium enrichment program or what nuclear secrets it may have shared with syria . both issues are reduced in the declaration to `` concerns '' pyongyang promises to address down the road . bush and secretary of state condoleezza rice have pledged a robust verification process to double-check north korea 's claims . and north korea has promised to allow u.s. inspectors access to the yongbyon facility and to interview its nuclear experts . but it is far from clear whether pyongyang will allow the kind of intrusive inspections of its entire nuclear arsenal that the united states will need to get a complete picture of north korea 's program . congressional republicans not so sure about pyongyang . the stiffest opposition to the deal is coming from conservative republicans . once considered president bush 's strongest allies in confronting north korea 's nuclear ambition , they feel that the bush administration has let north korea off the hook , especially when it comes to its enriched uranium program and suspected proliferation to syria . rep. ileana ros-lehtinen , r-florida , the top republican on the foreign affairs committee , expressed `` profound disappointment '' over bush 's announcement that north korea would be coming off the lists of enemies and state sponsors of terrorism . and rep. pete hoekstra , r-michigan , the top republican on the permanent select committee on intelligence , accused president bush of sacrificing its principles for a foreign policy success . `` a decision seemingly has been made that it is more important for the white house to reach a legacy agreement than to get to the bottom of north korea 's nuclear efforts , '' hoekstra said . `` lifting sanctions and removing north korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism flies in the face of history and rewards its brutal dictator for shallow gestures . '' rep. ed royce , r-california , called north korea 's declaration late and incomplete , alleging that north korea built a nuclear facility for syria , considered a terrorist state by the united states , while the nuclear negotiations were ongoing . that , he said , was proof that pyongyang ca n't be trusted . `` how do you have a meaningful declaration of your nuclear program without saying how many bombs you have ? '' royce asked . `` this is a signal to other proliferating regimes that nuclear weapons will be rewarded without ever having to give them up . '' democrats , who once criticized bush for not talking directly to north korea about its nuclear program , are cautiously supportive of the deal . howard berman , the democratic chairman of the house foreign affairs committee , called the north 's submission of a declaration `` encouraging . '' even former presidential candidate sen. john kerry , d-massachusetts , praised the bush administration , saying `` engaging our enemies can pay dividends . '' but kerry added , `` historians will long wonder why this administration did not directly engage north korea before pyongyang gathered enough material for several nuclear weapons , tested a nuclear device and the missiles to deliver them . '' are we headed down the same road with iran ? in his 2002 state of the union address , bush termed iraq , north korea and iran the `` axis of evil , '' saying they were `` arming to threaten the peace of the world . '' fourteen months after delivering that speech -- and after dictator saddam hussein released a 12,000-page declaration that it had no weapons of mass destruction -- u.s. forces invaded iraq . but no such program was found , nor were stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction . more than five years into the war , the united states is still battling al qaeda and iraqi insurgents there . six-party talks with north korea began in 2003 , after north korea withdrew from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . progress was limited until 2007 , when north korea agreed to shut down yongbyon and allow international monitors back into the country for monitoring and verification . progress has been even more limited for the third member of the `` axis of evil , '' iran . the bush administration has joined the other members of the u.n. security council -- britain , france , china and russia , along with germany -- in offering iran a set of political and economic incentives similar to the ones north korea was given in exchange for suspending its uranium enrichment program . but the united states has refused to sit down with iran until that suspension takes place . the u.n. security council has passed three resolutions imposing sanctions against iran , and the united states has worked with some success to isolate iran from the international financial community . but unlike north korea , which is isolated and desperately in need of international aid , iran is rich in oil and a powerful force in the middle east . and it 's only getting richer and more immune to sanctions as oil prices skyrocket . and iran seems to be running out the clock and waiting to try its luck with a new u.s. president . sen. barack obama , the presumptive democratic nominee , has pledged to engage iran in direct talks to try to curb its nuclear ambitions . sen. john mccain , the presumptive gop nominee , has taken a much tougher line , refusing to rule out military action to prevent a nuclear-armed iran . with the coming change in the u.s. administration , u.s. officials , diplomats and other iran experts believe that it would be at least eight months to a year before the united states and iran could seriously think about talking . meanwhile , by its own admission , iran continues to perfect its nuclear technology . if the north korean experience can serve as a lesson for the next u.s. president , that lesson may well be that the longer the united states waits to talk to iran , the higher the cost will be to get tehran out of the nuclear business .

759	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the bush administration has launched a `` significant escalation '' of covert operations in iran , sending u.s. commandos to spy on the country 's nuclear facilities and undermine the islamic republic 's government , journalist seymour hersh said sunday . an iranian flag flies outside the building containing the reactor of bushehr nuclear power plant , south of tehran . white house , cia and state department officials declined comment on hersh 's report , which appears in this week 's issue of the new yorker . hersh told cnn 's `` late edition with wolf blitzer '' that congress has authorized up to $ 400 million to fund the secret campaign , which involves u.s. special operations troops and iranian dissidents . president bush and vice president dick cheney have rejected findings from u.s. intelligence agencies that iran has halted a clandestine effort to build a nuclear bomb and `` do not want to leave iran in place with a nuclear program , '' hersh said . `` they believe that their mission is to make sure that before they get out of office next year , either iran is attacked or it stops its weapons program , '' hersh said . the new article , `` preparing the battlefield , '' is the latest in a series of articles accusing the bush administration of preparing for war with iran . he based the report on accounts from current and former military , intelligence , and congressional sources . watch hersh discuss what he says are the administration 's plans for iran '' `` as usual with his quarterly pieces , we 'll decline to comment , '' white house spokesman gordon johndroe told cnn . `` the cia , as a rule , does not comment on allegations regarding covert operations , '' cia spokesman paul gimigliano said . ryan crocker , the u.s. ambassador in baghdad , denied u.s. raids were being launched from iraq , where american commanders believe iran is stoking sectarian warfare and fomenting attacks on u.s. troops . `` i can tell you flatly that u.s. forces are not operating across the iraqi border into iran , in the south or anywhere else , '' crocker said . hersh said u.s. efforts were staged from afghanistan , which also shares a border with iran . he said the program resulted in `` a dramatic increase in kinetic events and chaos '' inside iran , including attacks by kurdish separatists in the country 's north and a may attack on a mosque in shiraz that killed 13 people . the united states has said it is trying to isolate iran diplomatically in order to get it to come clean about its nuclear ambitions . but bush has said `` all options '' are open in dealing with the issue . iran insists its nuclear program is aimed at providing civilian electric power , and refuses to comply with u.n. security council demands that it halt uranium enrichment work . u.n. nuclear inspectors say tehran held back critical information that could determine whether it is trying to make nuclear weapons . israel , which is believed to have its own nuclear arsenal , conducted a military exercise in the eastern mediterranean in early june involving dozens of warplanes and aerial tankers . the distance involved in the exercise was roughly the same as would be involved in a possible strike on the iranian nuclear fuel plant at natanz , iran , a u.s. military official said . in 1981 , israeli warplanes destroyed an iraqi nuclear reactor . iran 's parliament speaker , ali larijani , warned other countries against moves that would `` cost them heavily . '' in comments that appeared in the semi-official mehr news agency sunday , an iranian general said his troops were digging more than 320,000 graves to bury troops from any invading force with `` the respect they deserve . '' `` under the law of war and armed conflict , necessary preparations must be made for the burial of soldiers of aggressor nations , '' said maj. gen. mirfaisal baqerzadeh , an iranian officer in charge of identifying soldiers missing in action . journalist shirzad bozorghmehr in tehran , iran , contributed to this report .
760	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- after wrapping up the longest presidential primary campaign in modern history , sen. hillary clinton said tuesday that she is ready to turn her attention back to being the junior senator from new york . sen. hillary clinton is greeted with cheers as she returns to the senate after a two-week vacation . `` i look forward to being back with this great team , '' she said as she returned to the senate at the end of a two-week vacation , taken after she conceded the 17-month-long primary contest to sen. barack obama . the second-term new york democrat pledged to `` immerse myself in there , '' pointing to the chamber . she had just emerged from the party 's weekly luncheon , which senate majority leader harry reid called `` one of the most emotional caucuses '' he 's ever attended on capitol hill . he said the new york senator entered the event to a sea of high fives , cheers and a standing ovation from her democratic colleagues . clinton said the opportunity to run for the oval office allowed her to `` immerse myself in the extraordinary resilience and resourcefulness that is the american people . '' watch clinton being greeted with cheers '' `` i come back with an even greater depth of awareness about what we have to do here in washington , '' she said . `` so many of the concerns that people have expressed to me over the course of this campaign are ones that they ca n't individually solve . they ca n't even really take it on just at the state or local level . '' clinton said that in addition to working `` very hard to elect sen. obama our president , '' she plans to campaign on behalf of democratic senate candidates . `` we have been unfortunately stymied by the stalling tactics '' of republicans , she said , noting the need for 60 votes to get any legislation passed in the senate . `` it 's going to be up to the democratic party , and particularly the democratic senate , to make progress on everything from health care and the economy to ending the war in iraq , '' she said . `` i look forward to being back with this great team that we have here and doing everything i can to make that happen . '' clinton said she is not spending time on the possibility that she may be asked to fill the no. 2 spot on sen. barack obama 's presidential ticket . `` you know , it is not something that i think about , '' she said . `` this is totally sen. obama 's decision , and that 's the way it should be . '' but she made clear , as she tried to do in her ultimate concession speech june 7 , that her supporters should not stray toward john mccain , no matter any hard feelings left over from a bruising primary . `` anyone who voted for me has very little in common with the republican party , '' she said . thursday night , obama and clinton are set to meet with key donors in washington . the next day , the two will appear jointly in unity , new hampshire , a small town on that state 's western border where the two candidates tied in the january primary . `` this is going to be a symbolic event that i hope will rally the democratic party behind the nominee , '' she said . obama said he looked forward to working with clinton and her husband , former president clinton , on his campaign for the white house . `` bill clinton is one of the most intelligent , charismatic political leaders that we have seen in a generation , and he has got a lot of wisdom to impart , '' obama said tuesday . `` we are going to be working very closely with him and sen. clinton to make sure that we not only win in november , but we actually govern in a way that delivers on the promise of universal health care , good jobs and good wages , clean energy , lower gas prices , the things that are really going to make an impact on people 's lives , '' he said . watch obama discuss clintons ' role '' obama said the senator 's presidential campaign had `` enhanced '' her stature in a way that would bolster her efficacy in the senate . `` she garnered not just votes but passion and support of so many millions of people , '' obama said . `` she 's going to be a force to be reckoned with not only in the senate , but hopefully , if i 'm successful in the white house , she 's going to be one of my key partners in making sure that were moving forward on issues like healthcare that she cares so deeply about . '' at an event in riverside , california , sen. john mccain , the presumptive republican presidential nominee , said clinton is probably returning to the senate with greater political clout . `` i think , if i had to guess , that the fact that the she ran an honorable and incredibly long and dedicated campaign for the nomination of her party would indicate to me that she would probably return to the united states senate with enhanced prestige and enhanced influence , '' mccain said . he also praised clinton for her work on military matters since joining the legislative body in 2001 . `` i think that sen. clinton has already attained a position of leadership in the united states senate , '' he said . `` she works hard at her job . she is a very important member of the armed services committee , and i have worked together with her on a variety of national security issues .

762	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- senate republicans on tuesday blocked a democratic initiative that would have taxed the windfall profits oil companies have enjoyed due to rising energy prices , with the minority leader calling the proposal a `` gimmick . '' record energy prices have led to record profits for oil companies . the measure failed to achieve the 60 votes required by senate rules to proceed . the vote was 51-43 . six republicans , including three seeking re-election in november , broke ranks to support the bill . two democrats -- sen. mary landrieu of oil-producing state louisiana and majority leader harry reid , who voted no to be able to bring the measure back to the floor under senate rules -- voted against the measure . along with placing a special tax of 25 percent on oil companies , the bill would have permitted lawsuits against the organization of petroleum exporting countries , the oil-producing cartel , and suspended deposits into the strategic petroleum reserve . profits from renewable energy sources would be excluded from the tax . `` we 're not afraid , on this side , to go after big oil when they are not doing the right thing , '' said sen. charles schumer , d-new york . `` and we are not afraid to go after opec because they are a cartel that squeezes us . `` we 're not afraid to do some strong tough things that will -- some in the short run , some in the longer run -- that will bring down the price , the all too high price , of gasoline . '' sen. byron dorgan , d-north dakota , said the measure was needed to `` wring out '' speculators he blamed for driving the price of crude oil to more than $ 130 a barrel in recent weeks . but senate republicans insisted the new taxes ultimately would hurt consumers and cut american oil supply , saying democrats simply were playing election-year politics . the bill is `` pure and simple a pathetic attempt to even call itself an energy plan , '' said sen. kay bailey hutchison , r-texas . senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said , `` hitting the gas companies might make for good campaign literature or evening news clips , but it wo n't address the problem . this bill is n't a serious response to gas prices . it is just a gimmick . '' the kentucky republican added , `` they are hoping the idea of going after energy companies will create the illusion of action after a week in which they themselves fought for a bill that would make the problem worse . what a political charade . '' as the average cost of gas edged above $ 4 a gallon , high prices are definitely on the minds of voters . a cnn/opinion research corp. poll released tuesday shows 40 percent of respondents are more concerned about the cost of gasoline than long lines at the pump , which occurred during the energy crisis of the 1970s . but 55 percent of those surveyed are more worried about the long lines and rationing . the poll results reflect telephone interviews with 1,035 adults on wednesday and thursday . the margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points . cnn 's ted barrett , lisa desjardins , matt smith , virginia nicolaidis and scott j. anderson contributed to this report .
763	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush on monday signed a bill that will pay for the wars in iraq and afghanistan through the remainder of his presidency and into spring 2009 . president bush on monday said the men and women of the armed forces deserve `` our unflinching support . '' the supplemental spending bill provides nearly $ 162 billion in war funding without the restrictions congressional democrats vowed to put into place since they took control of congress nearly two years ago . after signing the bill , bush said the men and woman of the armed services are owed `` our unflinching support , and the best way to demonstrate that support is to give them the resources they need to do their jobs and to prevail . '' bush also said he appreciated that `` republicans and democrats in congress agreed to provide these vital funds without tying the hands of our commanders and without an artificial timetable of withdrawal from iraq . '' watch as bush thanks congress '' `` this bill shows the american people that even in an election year , republicans and democrats can come together to stand behind our troops and their families , '' bush said . he also touted the success of the `` surge '' strategy he implemented last year . `` our troops have driven the terrorists and extremists from many strongholds in iraq . today , violence is at the lowest level since march of 2004 , '' he said . `` as a result of this progress , some of our troops are coming home , as a result of our policy called ` return on success . ' we welcome them home . '' white houses spokeswoman dana perino called the bill a victory for the president . `` because we have seen success in the surge , perhaps congress decided that it was ok to allow the commander in chief to be able to move forward as he saw fit , '' said perino , noting the $ 162 billion was the same amount that the president had requested . the supplemental spending bill also contains a new gi bill that expands education benefits for veterans who have served since the 9/11 attacks , provides a 13-week extension of unemployment benefits and more than $ 2 billion in disaster assistance for parts of the midwest that have been hit by record floods . the signing comes two weeks before the deadline that defense secretary robert gates had established for the funds . gates said he would consider laying off defense department employees to balance the pentagon 's books if legislation was not signed by july 15 . watch a progress report from the u.s. ambassador to iraq '' house democrats had tried to include restrictions on war funding when they drafted the bill , but they were unable to overcome procedural hurdles that republicans put up . a compromise version of the supplemental bill was later negotiated between democratic and republican leaders that included the war funding along with the gi bill , unemployment benefits and disaster relief -- three top legislative priorities for the democrats that bush and congressional republicans originally resisted . `` at a time when 2 million men and women have fought in iraq and afghanistan and when our troops have had to endure multiple deployments , stop-loss policies , insufficient equipment and an unclear strategy , giving them the opportunity to fuel our future economy is the least we can do , '' senate majority leader harry reid , d-nevada , said of the gi bill after the senate sent it to the president 's desk thursday night . congressional democrats regained control of the house of representatives and senate after the 2006 midterm elections in large part to due to displeasure over the iraq war . but democrats -- lacking the 60 votes to overcome gop filibusters in the senate , let alone the two-thirds majorities in both the house and senate to override a presidential veto -- have been unable to pass significant restrictions on war funding because republicans , for the most part , have stuck with bush on the war .
764	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. barack obama defended his patriotism monday , telling a crowd in independence , missouri , that his `` deep and abiding love for this country '' is the reason he is running for president . sen. barack obama 's speech on patriotism comes days before the fourth of july . `` at certain times over the last 16 months , i have found , for the first time , my patriotism challenged -- at times as a result of my own carelessness , more often as a result of the desire by some to score political points and raise fears and doubts about who i am and what i stand for , '' he said in president harry truman 's hometown , just days before the fourth of july . obama vowed to never question the patriotism of others in the campaign , adding `` i will not stand idly by when i hear others question mine . '' obama has been defending his patriotism ever since the beginning of the primary season , when he was first criticized for not wearing a flag pin -- which he now does much more frequently -- and when false rumors began circulating that he did not say the pledge of allegiance . watch excerpts of obama 's speech '' a widely distributed photo also seemed to show him failing to place his hand over his heart during a rendition of `` the star-spangled banner . '' obama 's wife , michelle , also was criticized about her patriotism , after telling an audience at a campaign event , `` for the first time in my adult lifetime , i 'm really proud of my country . '' obama 's campaign said she was just excited about the campaign 's grassroots support , but her words still provided fodder for her husband 's opponents . at his appearance monday , barack obama appealed to unity . `` given the enormous challenges that lie before us , we can no longer afford these sorts of divisions , '' he said . `` none of us expect that arguments about patriotism will , or should , vanish entirely ; after all , when we argue about patriotism , we are arguing about who we are as a country , and more importantly , who we should be . `` but surely , we can agree that no party or political philosophy has a monopoly on patriotism . and surely , we can arrive at a definition of patriotism that , however rough and imperfect , captures the best of america 's common spirit . '' obama said that for him , `` patriotism starts as a gut instinct , a loyalty and love for country that 's rooted in some of my earliest memories . '' obama described how as he grew up , his patriotism matured to something that `` would survive my growing awareness of our nation 's imperfections : its ongoing racial strife ; the perversion of our political system that were laid bare during the watergate hearings ; the wrenching poverty of the mississippi delta and the hills of appalachia . '' obama said he learned that `` what makes america great has never been its perfection , but the belief that it can be made better . '' patriotism , he said , must involve the willingness to sacrifice . he called attention to the service of john mccain , the presumptive republican candidate . mccain 's campaign has been calling on obama to condemn comments from retired gen. wesley clark , who said this weekend that mccain 's service in vietnam did not necessarily mean that he was qualified to serve as commander-in-chief . read about what clark said . clark is a military adviser for obama . in his speech monday , obama did not directly address clark 's comments , but after calling attention to mccain 's service , he said `` no one should ever devalue that service , especially for the sake of a political campaign , and that goes for supporters of both sides . '' `` we must always express our profound gratitude for the service of our men and women in uniform . period , '' he said . just as obama was finishing his speech , his campaign released a statement about clark 's remarks . `` as he 's said many times before , sen. obama honors and respects sen. mccain 's service , and of course he rejects yesterday 's statement by gen. clark , '' obama campaign spokesman bill burton said . meanwhile , mccain 's campaign announced monday it was launching a new truth squad to defend the arizona senator 's military record . leaders of the latest group include mccain 's fellow vietnam prisoners of war air force col. bud day and marine lt. col. orson swindle , along with former navy pilot carl smith , who served with him . mccain said monday he was proud of his record of service . watch mccain 's response to clark 's comments '' `` the important thing is that if that 's the kind of campaign that sen. obama and his surrogates and his supporters want to engage in , i understand that , '' he said . `` but it does n't reduce the price of a gallon of gas by one penny . it does n't achieve our energy independence or make it come any closer ... and it certainly does n't do anything to address the challenges that americans have in keeping their jobs , their homes and supporting their families . '' obama was to follow up monday 's speech on patriotism with an address tuesday about faith and remarks later in the week on service . he will spend his fourth of july in butte , montana , campaigning with his family . mccain on monday was campaigning in pennsylvania , a battleground state in the general election . he was scheduled to speak with reporters in harrisburg before holding a town hall meeting in pipersville . mccain leaves for colombia on tuesday and will travel to mexico later in the week . his campaign on monday unveiled his new campaign airplane , a boeing 737-400 . the aircraft shares its name -- the `` straight talk express '' with mccain 's campaign bus , which has been a staple of the candidate 's 2000 and 2008 campaigns . the 95-seat plane -- with seats for the candidate , his staffers and the press -- has the `` straight talk express '' logo emblazoned on its fuselage . cnn 's tasha diakides and chris welch contributed to this report .
765	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- bangladesh police have detained or arrested more than 18,000 people in the last 11 days in a crackdown on crime they say is aimed at improving security ahead of december elections . people arrested by bangladesh police in their latest round-up arrive at a jail in dhaka . human rights groups decry the actions as politically motivated . the round-ups began may 28 , days after the two main political parties said they would not cooperate with the military-backed caretaker government on organizing the elections . police told cnn that by saturday 16,916 arrests had been made , while local media reported another 1,548 were arrested sunday . the awami league and the bangladesh nationalist party -lrb- bnp -rrb- said hundreds of their party members had been taken into custody . `` the timing and targets of the arrests are a dead giveaway they are politically motivated , '' brad adams of the new york-based human rights watch said in a statement . `` it 's obvious that they are paying the price for the political parties ' refusal to accept the government 's conditions to participate in the elections . '' the government rejects the allegations . the detentions , it said , are part of a planned sweep to rid the country of criminals . `` our igp -lsb- inspector general of police , or chief of police -rsb- categorically said this special drive was being conducted to create a congenial atmosphere before the general election , '' said kamrul ahsan , a spokesman for bangladesh police . `` it is not politically motivated , '' he said . `` the intention is not to harass anybody politically . '' the crackdown began after the awami league and the bnp said they would not cooperate with the government to develop a roadmap toward democracy unless it first releases the parties ' leaders . the two women who head the parties -- sheikh hasina of the awami league and khaleda zia of the bnp -- are in police custody on corruption-related charges . hasina is charged with bribe-taking . zia is being held on charges of graft for improperly awarding a multi-million dollar government contract . the current political crisis in the muslim-majority south asian country of 150 million can be traced , in large part , to the lingering animosity between the two women , political observers say . their rivalry runs so deep that the women are known in the country as the `` battling begums . '' begum is an honorific given to women of rank in the country . since the country 's independence in 1972 , the awami league or the bnp has ruled bangladesh for all but eight years . both women have served as prime minister at one point or another . after its last stint in power ended in 2006 , the bnp handed over rule to a caretaker government to conduct elections , as mandated by the country 's constitution . but the awami league refused to recognize the neutrality of the interim government . hasina accused zia of stocking it with bnp backers . supporters and party members took to the streets in months of deadly clashes . to stem the tide of violence , a military-backed government took control in january 2007 and imposed an indefinite state of emergency . it also postponed elections until it said it could clean up the country 's graft-ridden politics . the caretaker government adopted the emergency powers rules . the rules allowed authorities to arrest people without a warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was connected to a crime , human rights watch said . a wave of detentions followed . by some estimates more than 90,000 people were detained before some were released and others charged with crimes . among those arrested were more than 150 top politicians , including hasina and zia -- leading to the current political stalemate . the government wants to hold elections in the third week of december , and said the crusade on crime is part of its plan to ensure trouble-free balloting . the political parties allege the arrests are intended to pave the way for the election of pro-government candidates . they want their leaders set free before they sit down and talk with the government about a roadmap toward a successful election . they also threatened to organize mass movements to secure their leaders ' release . `` it 's kind of an impasse , '' said taleya rehman , founder and executive director of the bangladesh-based non-profit democracy watch . `` the government is conducting political dialogue with small parties . but they are of no significance . they need the two major parties . '' on monday , the government announced it was releasing hasina from custody on medical grounds so she can go abroad for treatment . a similar release for zia was also expected . party members say the government 's move is a ploy to sideline the pair from the elections by sending them out of the country . hasina has a damaged ear resulting from a bombing attack that targeted her four years ago . zia is believed to have arthritis . meanwhile , the detentions continue -- almost 1,800 a day . in addition to political party members , the crackdown has also swept up several journalists . `` that actually makes the arrests suspicious in some people 's minds , '' said sultana kamal , executive director of the legal aid group , ain o salish kendro -lrb- law and adjudication center -rrb- . `` if you just arrest any tom , dick and harry saying this person may have arms , then people will legitimately raise questions about the mode of the whole operation .

'' court documents released friday say carson was kidnapped from her apartment and forced to provide her abductors with atm access to her bank account before she was shot to death in the early hours of march 5 . the documents -- applications for search warrants -- say a confidential informant told police in the days after the death that atwater had told her he and lovette had entered carson 's home through an open door and forced carson to accompany them in her car . the informant said she had talked with atwater after a picture was displayed on television showing someone attempting to use carson 's atm card at a convenience store two days after carson 's body was found . the informant said the two men drove carson to an atm , obtaining her pin number from her . `` the cw -lsb- informant -rsb- learned that carson was forced into the back seat with atwater , and lovette drove carson 's vehicle , '' the court documents said . `` that information is consistent with video footage taken from an atm camera on that date . '' the witness told police atwater said the two got about $ 1,400 from carson 's account . bank records show that was approximately the amount taken from the account over a two-day period , the documents said . and the informant said that both suspects shot carson , according to one of the affidavits . `` this information was corroborated by crime scene search information that two separate weapons were used in the homicide , '' the documents said . the documents said police believe carson was subjected to a sexual assault `` of an unknown nature '' and asked for a search warrant to collect dna swabs from the suspects . but orange county , north carolina , district attorney jim woodall told cnn friday the collection and testing done on carson 's body was routine , and authorities do not believe she was sexually assaulted . prosecutors had fought to keep her autopsy sealed . following a motion by the raleigh news & observer newspaper , prosecutors agreed to allow the report 's release . carson , a native of athens , georgia , was a pre-medicine student double-majoring in political science and biology . she was a recipient of the university 's prestigious morehead scholarship and a member of the phi beta kappa honor society , unc has said .
778	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.s. food and drug administration tuesday ordered the makers of certain antibiotics to add a `` black box '' label warning -- the fda 's strongest -- to alert patients of possible tendon ruptures and tendonitis . cipro is one of the drugs for which the fda will require a `` black box '' label warning about tendon problems . `` the new language will strengthen the existing warnings , '' said dr. edward cox , director of the fda 's office of antimicrobial products . the fda is requiring the label warnings and a medication guide for fluoroquinolone drugs , which include cipro , levaquin , avelox , noroxin and floxin . the consumer group public citizen asked the fda in august 2006 to put the `` black box '' warning on cipro and other fluoroquinolones , and also to warn doctors . earlier this year , public citizen filed a lawsuit to force the fda to take those actions . public citizen said tuesday it was `` pleased '' with the fda 's order but added `` there is still more that the fda must do . '' `` the fda is silent on our request that it also send a warning letter to physicians clearly describing possible adverse reactions , such as tendon pain , so that patients can be switched to alternative treatments before tendons rupture , '' the group said . `` we are troubled that the fda is not doing everything within its power to prevent more people from needlessly suffering disabling tendon ruptures . '' when asked about the lawsuit and why it did n't order the `` black box '' label warning until now , cox stressed that the fda included warning information with the drugs from 2001 until 2004 , and updated the information last year . dr. gupta explains more on antibiotic risks '' `` there has been ongoing work to update the labeling of the fluoroquinolone drug products , '' cox said . `` we have been working on this issue and making progress over time . '' the companies that make the fluoroquinolone drugs will be required to submit label safety changes and the medication guide within 30 days of receiving the notification from the fda or provide a reason why they do not believe such labeling changes are necessary , cox said . bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals inc. , which holds licenses for cipro and avelox , said it would make the changes requested by the fda but defended the drugs as `` well-tolerated and effective in all approved indications . '' schering-plough markets cipro and avelox in the united states under agreement with bayer . ortho-mcneil-janssen pharmaceuticals , which markets levaquin in the united states , also said it would abide by the fda 's request . merck & co. , the maker of noroxin , said it , too , would update the drug 's label . but merck noted it has stopped promotion of noroxin because of the widespread availability of its generic form . oscient pharmaceuticals -lrb- factive -rrb- , daiichi sankyo -lrb- floxin -rrb- and dipomed -lrb- proquin -rrb- did not immediately respond to cnn 's requests for comment . the fluoroquinolones drugs can increase the risk of tendonitis and tendon rupture -- which is about 1 in 100,000 -- by three to four times , according to the fda 's dr. renata albrecht . `` this risk is further increased in those over age 60 , in kidney , heart , and lung transplant recipients , and with use of concomitant steroid therapy , '' the fda said in a statement . albrecht said that sometimes patients have no symptoms before they experience a rupture in their tendon -- commonly their achilles tendon . `` sometimes it 's been reported on the first day of taking a fluoroquinolone ... a sudden snap or popping sound that is tendon rupture with no preceding warning , '' she said . normally , she added , that patients experience some pain or inflammation `` a week or two before the patient will rupture . '' public citizen , founded in 1971 by consumer activist ralph nader , said more than 400 cases of tendon rupture and more than 300 cases of tendonitis in patients using fluoroquinolones were reported between november 1997 and december 2007 . `` because only a small fraction of cases are typically reported to the fda , the actual number of ruptures and other tendon injuries attributable to the antibiotic is much higher , '' the group said . the fda would only say that it has received `` hundreds '' of reports of tendon problems linked to fluoroquinolones , without being more specific , citing the ongoing lawsuit . but cox said `` the fda continues to receive a considerable number of reports on tendon adverse effects . '' patients should stop taking fluoroquinolone antibiotics at the first sign of tendon pain , avoid exercise and contact their doctor , the fda said . cox said the fda would not require companies to send letters to doctors alerting them about the connection between tendon problems and the antibiotics . `` it is possible under rems -lsb- risk evaluation and mitigation strategy -rsb- to ask for a letter -lsb- to doctors -rsb- , '' cox said . `` certainly for sponsors that would choose to go forward with a letter , we 'll be happy to work with them .

782	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- north korea 's apparent cooperation with nations seeking to end its nuclear weapons ambitions -- six years after a deal collapsed and two years after testing a bomb -- may lead to questions about why it would play ball now . some signs show north korean leader kim jong il does intend to drop his nuclear weapon program , experts say . one school of thought : the communist nation , in desperate economic straits , has long been willing to drop its program for better relations with the united states . but mistakes on both sides interfered , according to jim walsh , a national security analyst . north korea could be trying to achieve survival through deceit , intending to keep its nuclear weapons as blackmail for better treatment , analysts suggest . but those making a case for north korea 's sincerity , walsh said , would say it must `` do the things economically that -lsb- it needs -rsb- to do to avoid collapse . '' `` having nuclear weapons when the regime is collapsing wo n't do them much good , '' said walsh , a research associate at the massachusetts institute of technology . north korea , following a 2007 agreement with five nations including the u.s. , handed over a declaration of its nuclear program on thursday . the nation also took steps to disable a reactor that officials acknowledge helped extract plutonium to build nuclear weapons . on friday , it destroyed the reactor 's cooling tower -- significant because the tower would take a year or longer to rebuild . watch the tower being demolished . '' after north korea 's declaration , president bush said thursday that he intends to move north korea from the u.s. list of states that sponsor terrorism . down the line , north korea would receive economic and energy assistance if the u.s. and other nations agree it is complying with other efforts to dismantle its nuclear program . north korea has been heavily sanctioned in the past because of its nuclear program . stephen hadley , the u.s. national security adviser , told reporters thursday that the terror list was one incentive for north korea to drop its nuclear ambitions . `` i think it is important to them not to be on a list that says ` enemies ' and not to be on a list that says ` supporters of terror , ' '' hadley said . walsh said north korea has been weakened by sanctions and its lack of arable land , leading to a population unable to feed itself . `` it ca n't grow enough food , '' walsh said . `` and they 've got to attract foreign investors . '' he said north korea was better off in the days of the soviet union , when it had an ample amount of communist nations with which to trade . but the soviet union collapsed , and many other nations turned away from communism , leaving north korea increasingly isolated . `` geostrategically , north korea was growing weaker , and everyone around them was growing stronger , '' walsh said . in 1994 , north korea pledged to the u.s. that it would freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear program in exchange for international aid , including help building two power-producing nuclear reactors . by 2000 , however , north korea was complaining that not all the aid was coming as promised . in 2002 , the u.s. accused north korea of working on a secret nuclear weapons program , and the u.s. said north korea admitted doing so . countries including the u.s. halted oil supplies , and north korea withdrew from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty . it conducted an underground test of a nuclear weapon in 2006 . walsh said both sides have n't fully lived up to previous agreements . the u.s. , he said , promised normalized trade at one point but did n't follow through . jon wolfsthal , senior fellow of the center for strategic and international studies ' international security program , said north korea has been `` remarkably consistent '' regarding its reactions to u.s. positions . `` when we 've engaged them directly , they have responded . and when we have reduced our commitment , to our engagement ... they have responded negatively , '' wolfsthal said . wolfsthal said china -- which provides oil and food aid to north korea -- has been instrumental in getting north korea to cooperate . `` china has gone from being an uninvested ... mediator to being a true participant in this process -- from a country that originally wanted to help the u.s. and north korea work out their differences to a state that has worked to convince north korea to meet its obligations , '' wolfsthal said . wolfsthal said he believes china was embarrassed by north korea 's nuclear test , and shifted course . `` i think that over time , the united states has helped china see that north korea 's unpredictable behavior destabilizes their own backyard , '' he said . walsh and wolfsthal said another theory has it that north korea is only playing with negotiators and intends to keep its nuclear program and weapons as a security blanket . expanding on that possibility , wolfsthal said north korea leader kim jong il could keep the country 's nuclear arsenal but agree not to produce any more nuclear weapons . `` everybody 's speculating . none of us has met kim jong il , '' wolfsthal said . walsh said the west does n't have hard evidence to determine north korea 's intentions . `` but so far , the evidence is pretty strongly on the side of north korea wanting a real bargain , '' walsh said .

'' a letter sent by gershon 's attorneys to vanity fair editor-in-chief graydon carter , obtained by cnn , demanded a published correction and retraction and threatened possible litigation for defamation . the actress appeared in 1995 's `` showgirls '' and the more recent `` p.s. i love you . '' gershon `` is extremely offended by the false and defamatory inference that she engaged in an adulterous relationship with the president , '' the letter says , adding that the actress has been in the same room with clinton three times , always in the presence of at least a dozen people . `` it is apparent that vanity fair was intent upon publishing unsubstantiated rumors , and that it avoided learning the true facts so that the truth would not get in the way , '' the letter says . `` such conduct is reckless and malicious , giving rise to substantial liability for defamation . '' in a statement , vanity fair denied that the article indicates any `` improper relationship '' between clinton and gershon . `` the story merely examines the concerns of some of clinton 's aides about reports of his behavior , '' the magazine said . `` we do n't believe that any correction is warranted . '' purdum 's article , `` the comeback id , '' quoted multiple anonymous sources questioning the former president 's behavior since leaving the white house . the article suggested that clinton 's personality had changed since his 2004 heart bypass surgery and said there were reports of clinton `` seeing a lot of women on the road . '' clinton issued a tirade against purdum on monday when asked by huffington post writer mayhill fowler what he thought of `` the hatchet job somebody did on you in vanity fair , '' according to a recording of the exchange posted on the huffington post 's web site . '' -lsb- he 's -rsb- sleazy , '' clinton responded . `` he 's a really dishonest reporter . '' clinton said that he had not read the article but that he was told that `` there 's five or six just blatant lies in there . but he 's a real slimy guy . '' calling purdum a `` scumbag , '' clinton said `` he 's one of the guys that propagated all those lies about whitewater for kenneth starr . he 's just a dishonest guy -- ca n't help it . '' purdum `` did n't use a single name , he did n't cite a single source in all those things he said , '' the former president said , adding that the article was `` part of the national media 's attempt to nail hillary for obama . `` anytime you read a story that slimes a public figure with anonymous quotes , it ought to make the bells go off in your head , '' he said . jay carson , a spokesman for hillary clinton 's campaign , said late monday that `` president clinton was understandably upset about an outrageously unfair article , but the language today was inappropriate , and he wishes he had not used it . '' purdum , a former new york times reporter who covered the clinton white house and is married to former clinton press secretary dee dee myers , defended his article on cnn 's `` the situation room '' on monday afternoon , saying he was `` very careful to say there is no clear-cut evidence that president clinton has done anything improper . '' `` i reject the notion that i 'm making an insinuation , '' purdum said . `` but i 'm very comfortable quoting the people i quote because i know who they are , and i know that they are very senior people who have known president clinton for a very long time and work for him at very high levels .

'' later on thursday , obama traveled to fairfax , virginia , to unveil a plan meant to increase women 's economic security . the plan includes a tax credit of up to $ 1,000 for families , an increase in the minimum wage and tax cuts to help working women pay for child care , among other provisions . clinton , who introduced obama , urged her supporters to back the illinois senator , saying , `` it is critical that we join forces . the democratic party is a family -- sometimes dysfunctional . '' watch clinton make her case for obama '' `` we shared this remarkable journey , and i could not be prouder to have this opportunity in front of so many of my friends and supporters to express my confidence in his candidacy and my commitment to ensuring that he will take the oath of office come next january 2009 , '' she said . obama , in turn , praised clinton for her historic presidential run , saying , `` while this campaign has shown us how far we have to go , we also know that because of what hillary accomplished , my daughters and yours look at america and themselves a little differently today . '' watch why obama and clinton are appearing together '' despite the public calls for unity , some of clinton 's supporters have been hesitant to fall in behind obama . with clinton 's debt yet to be paid off , some of her supporters are balking at the idea of donating to obama -- especially if he does not choose her to be his running mate . `` i certainly know there are lots of people who are withholding their money , '' said lynn forester de rothschild , one of clinton 's `` hill-raisers '' who raised over $ 100,000 for the former first lady . watch why some clinton backers are balking '' `` this is a hard decision for me personally because frankly i do n't like him . i feel like he is an elitist . i feel like he has not given me reason to trust him , '' rothschild said . that sentiment may be sending some clinton fans into sen. john mccain 's court . according to a cnn/opinion research corp. poll released last week , the number of clinton supporters who say they plan to defect to the republican presidential nominee 's camp is down from a month ago -- but numbers of those who say they plan to vote for obama are also down . rep. debbie wasserman schultz , d-florida , spent two days in new york this week with disaffected clinton supporters . `` it 's not unexpected that they would n't just automatically shift over to obama , because they 're not the typical democratic supporters that just automatically shift over , '' she said . `` they need to be wooed . they need to be won over .

787	buenos aires , argentina -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- argentine farmers are planning their next move after the country 's president announced plans to fund a public works program with revenues from a controversial agrarian export tax . argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner has rejected demands for the repeal of an export tax . eduardo buzzi , president of the argentine agrarian federation , said the organization 's directory board will meet friday to discuss what steps it plans to take in response to president cristina fernandez de kirchner 's announcement . `` we call on farmers across the country to stay calm but to stay on the alert , '' the organization said on its web site tuesday . the 44 percent export tax , which applies to soybeans , wheat , corn and sunflower seeds , has caused a three-month-old standoff between the government and farmers . argentina is the world 's second-largest corn exporter and third-largest soybean exporter . on monday , farmers suspended roadblocks that had snarled traffic across the country , though reports indicated that groups in some rural areas were still blocking roads tuesday . kirchner has argued that the tax , which was implemented march 11 , pays for increases in seniors ' pensions and financial assistance for the poor . she has rejected the farmers ' demands for a repeal of the export tax as `` extortion . '' monday marked the first time kirchner revealed details of how the government plans to use profits from the tax , which has generated about u.s. $ 1.5 billion , to lift people out of poverty . `` it is impossible to attack the problem of the poor without distribution of revenue and without touching extraordinary profits , '' she said in a televised address . kirchner said the social redistribution program will include the construction of 30 hospitals and more than 300 health-care centers , as well as investments in the country 's rural roads and in housing . in an apparent criticism of the farmers , she lamented `` the reaction of some who refuse to contribute in the redistribution '' to `` those who have least . '' she apologized , however , at the close of her speech for offending anyone . analysts suggested that the tax was a `` strong attack '' on on the farmers and their arguments against it . claudio loser , a visiting senior fellow at the inter-american dialogue policy analysis center , said it could result in argentine society being `` less sympathetic to the farmers , '' noting that it was `` surprising '' that the government did n't come up with the plan until the tax was three months old . loser , who is from argentina , also predicted that a continuation of the tax would provoke farmers into not investing . externally , the standoff has had a two-pronged effect on argentina , he said . `` the conflict has resulted in a loss of market for argentina , '' he said , as other countries have gone elsewhere for products . loser also said foreign investors may be more reluctant to invest in argentina now . cnn 's carolina cayazzo and taylor gandossy contributed to this report .

'' in an editorial in the new york daily news , the democratic presidential hopeful also acknowledged her dwindling chances of winning the nomination , saying she is aware of `` the odds '' against her . headlined `` hillary : why i continue to run , '' the editorial began with an explanation of her reference to the assassination when she was speaking to the argus leader newspaper in south dakota . she said she was pointing out that presidential primary campaigns have continued into june . `` almost immediately , some took my comments entirely out of context and interpreted them to mean something completely different -- and completely unthinkable , '' she wrote . watch hillary 's camp insist the remark had nothing to do with obama '' clinton said the newspaper 's editor and bobby kennedy jr. issued statements arguing that was the meaning of her remark . no other member of the kennedy family has issued a public statement on the matter . `` i realize that any reference to that traumatic moment for our nation can be deeply painful -- particularly for members of the kennedy family , who have been in my heart and prayers over this past week , '' she said , in a reference to sen. edward kennedy 's diagnosis with brain cancer . `` and i expressed regret right away for any pain i caused . `` but i was deeply dismayed and disturbed that my comment would be construed in a way that flies in the face of everything i stand for -- and everything i am fighting for in this election . '' some people -- particularly a number of bloggers -- have suggested she was imagining the possibility that sen. barack obama , the likely nominee , could be assassinated . after clinton 's initial remarks to the newspaper were reported , the obama campaign issued a statement saying the comment `` was unfortunate and has no place in this campaign . '' but obama himself later said , `` i do n't think that senator clinton intended anything by it , '' and that `` we should put it behind us . '' clinton campaign chairman terry mcauliffe , in an interview sunday , criticized the obama campaign 's first move . `` it 's unfortunate -- a hyped-up press over memorial day weekend , the obama campaign inflaming it , tried to take these words out of context , '' he told `` fox news sunday . '' asked about the remark by obama himself , mcauliffe responded , `` that 's great , but friday they were all part of this process . the press secretary came out and attacked senator clinton and got it going so the story would be around for three days . '' howard wolfson , a clinton adviser , told cbs ' `` face the nation '' that the obama campaign 's first statement critical of clinton was `` unfortunate . '' but obama 's chief strategist david axelrod told abc 's `` this week '' that `` we take her at her word , '' and he added , `` we 're beyond that issue now , so certainly we 're not trying to stir the issue up . '' the program 's host , george stephanopoulos , noted that a member of obama 's staff sent to the media saturday a `` searing commentary '' by msnbc 's keith olbermann slamming clinton for her remark . `` mr. olbermann did his commentary and he had his opinion , '' axelrod responded , adding , `` as far as we 're concerned , this issue is done . '' on another front , axelrod slammed clinton for suggesting she leads obama in the popular vote . clinton has been making that argument , based on figures that include florida and michigan , even though obama took his name off the ballot in michigan and neither candidate campaigned in florida . the democratic party discounted both states ' primaries before they took place . `` it would take some very tortured math and tortured logic to say that she 's ahead in the popular vote , '' axelrod told abc . he added , `` this is n't ` american idol , ' ok ? this is a nominating process . we have rules . we elect delegates state by state . '' in her column , clinton said she believes she can still `` win on the merits . '' `` i am not unaware of the challenges or the odds of my securing the nomination -- but this race remains extraordinarily close , and hundreds of thousands of people in upcoming primaries are still waiting to vote , '' she wrote . she added that her parents `` did not raise me to be a quitter -- and too many people still come up to me at my events , grip my arm and urge me not to walk away before this contest is over . '' she also said she is running `` because i believe staying in this race will help unite the democratic party . i believe that if senator obama and i both make our case -- and all democrats have the chance to make their voices heard -- in the end , everyone will be more likely to rally around the nominee . '' she repeated her vow to campaign for obama if he gets the nomination , and wrote , `` no matter what happens in this primary , i am committed to unifying this party . '' obama was in middleton , connecticut , where he was standing in for the ailing edward kennedy who was scheduled to deliver the commencement at wesleyan university . watch obama tell graduates they have an obligation '' the theme of obama 's speech was service , and the senator asked graduates to volunteer their time at home and abroad to fight poverty , preserve peace and protect the environment . `` but i hope you 'll remember , during those times of doubt and frustration , that there is nothing naive about your impulse to change this world , '' he said . `` because all it takes is one act of service -- one blow against injustice -- to send forth that tiny ripple of hope that robert kennedy spoke of .

'' suzan hubbard , director of the division of adult institutions , decided that susan atkins ' request should not be sent to the sentencing court for consideration , said terry thornton , spokeswoman for the california department of corrections and rehabilitation . hubbard 's recommendation is advisory and will not necessarily prevent atkins ' release . the court -- not the department or the state board of parole hearings -- has the final say on whether atkins should be released , thornton said . `` they 're the only ones legally who can recall the sentence , '' she added . atkins , 60 , was convicted in the 1969 slayings of actress sharon tate and four others . she had been incarcerated at the california institution for women in corona , california , but has been hospitalized since mid-march . her request is now before the board of parole hearings , which is conducting an independent investigation and will hear the case during its monthly public meeting , thornton said . the next meeting is scheduled july 15 . atkins had been held for years at the corona prison , which earlier determined that she met the criteria for compassionate release under the law , and sent her request to the corrections department . the board of parole hearings will receive public comment , discuss the request in closed session and then announce its recommendation . the board also can decide whether to refer the request to the sentencing court . the court , based in los angeles , can either grant or deny atkins ' request . it also can recall her life sentence and resentence atkins to a lesser term , allowing for her to be paroled . in 2007 , the department received 60 compassionate release requests , thornton said . ten were approved . citing privacy rules , prison officials would not disclose the nature of atkins ' illness . her husband and attorney , james whitehouse , has been quoted as saying she has terminal brain cancer , according to a blog called manson family today . she also has had a leg amputated , the los angeles times has reported . atkins , known within the manson family as `` sadie mae glutz , '' has been in prison since 1971 and has been denied parole 11 times . she is california 's longest-serving female inmate . tate and three houseguests were slain in august 1969 by killers who burst into her benedict canyon home . a teenager who was visiting the home 's caretaker in his cottage on the property also was killed . according to historical accounts of the murders , atkins stabbed tate , who was 8 1/2 months pregnant , and wrote the word `` pig '' in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with her husband , director roman polanski . the following night , leno and rosemary labianca were slain in their home in the los feliz neighborhood of los angeles . the two-day crime spree sent shock waves throughout los angeles . all of the killers remain behind bars . atkins also was convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher gary hinman . atkins , like family leader charles manson , received a death sentence . her punishment was changed to life in prison when the california supreme court ruled the state 's death penalty unconstitutional in 1972 . atkins is a born-again christian , according to a web site maintained by her husband . during her incarceration , the site says , atkins has worked to help at-risk youth , victims of violent crimes and homeless children . last month , authorities dug for buried bodies at the inyo county , california , ranch where manson and his followers once lived , after police became aware that testing had indicated humans might be buried there . nothing was found , police said .

792	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- susan atkins , a terminally ill former charles manson follower convicted in the murder of actress sharon tate , on tuesday was denied a compassionate release from prison . susan atkins , califorina 's longest-serving female inmate , is shown in her most recent mug shot . atkins , 60 , has been diagnosed with brain cancer and has had a leg amputated , her attorney said . in june , she requested the release , available to terminally ill inmates with less than six months to live . the california board of parole hearings ' decision -- posted tuesday on its web site -- came after a public hearing on atkins ' request . it means the request will not be forwarded to the los angeles superior court that sentenced atkins . the court would have had the final say on atkins ' release . her attorney , eric p. lampel , called the parole board 's decision `` unfortunate . '' '' -lsb- the board -rsb- ignored the vast majority of evidence presented , '' lampel said . `` there was a huge amount of pro-compassionate release testimony from many witnesses . it apparently fell on deaf ears . '' known within the manson family as sadie mae glutz , atkins and four others were convicted in connection with the deaths of five people , including tate , in august 1969 . according to historical accounts of the murder , atkins stabbed tate , who was eight months pregnant , and scrawled the word `` pig '' in blood on the door of the home the actress shared with director roman polanski . by her own admission , atkins held tate down and rejected her pleas for mercy , stabbing the pregnant woman 16 times . atkins ' request roused long-dormant memories of the two-day killing spree that terrorized los angeles and left seven people dead . it polarized those who were involved in the case -- and even those who were n't -- over whether she should die behind bars . atkins told a 1993 parole board that tate pleaded for her unborn child 's life as she held her down . `` she asked me to let her baby live , '' atkins said . '' ... i told her i did n't have any mercy on her . '' three of tate 's houseguests were also slain by the killers , as was a teenager visiting the home 's caretaker in his cottage out back . atkins was also convicted in the earlier murder of music teacher gary hinman . one of the first people atkins confessed to was virginia graham , who shared a cell with her before investigators determined the manson family was responsible for the murders . graham said last month she believed atkins should die in prison . `` she showed that poor woman absolutely no mercy , none , '' graham said . `` so why should anybody show her mercy at this time ? '' sharon tate 's sister , debra , has staunchly opposed atkins ' release . `` she will be set free when judged by god , '' debra tate has said . `` it 's important that she die in incarceration . '' los angeles county district attorney steve cooley said monday he was strongly opposed to the release , saying in a letter to the board it would be `` an affront to people of this state , the california criminal justice system and the next of kin of many murder victims . '' cooley noted in his letter that atkins was initially sentenced to death , like others in the manson family , including its leader , charles manson . their sentences were commuted to life in prison in 1972 , when the u.s. supreme court struck down the death penalty laws as they were written at the time . california gov. arnold schwarzenegger said tuesday he was also opposed to releasing atkins . `` i do n't believe in -lsb- compassionate release -rsb- , '' the governor told reporters . `` i think that they have to stay in , they have to serve their time . '' even if atkins is dying , schwarzenegger said , `` those kinds of crimes are just so unbelievable that i 'm not for the compassionate release . '' earlier , suzan hubbard , director of adult prisons in california , also recommended against granting atkins ' request . vincent bugliosi , who prosecuted atkins and other members of the manson family , said he supported her release , if only to save the state money . through monday , the cost for atkins ' medical care since she was hospitalized march 18 totaled more than $ 1.15 million , and the costs for guarding her hospital room are more than $ 308,000 , said california department of corrections and rehabilitation spokeswoman terry thornton . terminally ill inmates rarely are allowed compassionate release , records show . in 2007 , 60 such requests were made to the department , thornton has said . ten were approved . atkins , who has been incarcerated since 1971 , is california 's longest-serving female inmate . according to a web site maintained by her husband and attorney , james whitehouse , she is now a born-again christian . during her incarceration , the site says , atkins worked to help at-risk youth , violent crime victims and homeless children , among others . the web site does not mention atkins ' illness . lampel said last month atkins is paralyzed on one side . `` she can talk a little bit , '' lampel said . `` she ca n't sit up in bed without assistance , and obviously she ca n't walk around because she 's an amputee . '' atkins has expressed remorse for her crimes . `` i know the pain i caused mrs. tate , '' she said at a parole board hearing in 1985 . ln may , authorities dug for buried bodies at the inyo county , california , ranch where manson and his followers once lived , after police became aware that testing had indicated human remains might be buried there . nothing was found , authorities said . cnn 's ted rowlands contributed to this report .

'' bush said he would raise concerns when he meets chinese president hu jintao at the olympics , but he was also `` looking forward to cheering the u.s. athletes . '' he said it was good for them `` to see their president waving that flag . '' japan 's prime minister yasuo fukuda also said he would attend the opening ceremony despite concerns about human rights in china that prompted some other european leaders to boycott the event . bush and fukuda took questions from reporters at the picturesque lakeside resort of toyako on the northern island of hokkaido , where the g-8 summit will begin monday . watch bush , first lady arrive in japan '' bush said he and fukuda discussed the united states ' recent decision to lift some sanctions against north korea and remove the communist nation from the state department 's list of state sponsors of terror . bush assured japan that the issue of north korea 's past kidnappings of japanese citizens will not be ignored by the united states . he told fukuda that he was `` fully aware of the sensitivity of the issue in your country '' and that `` the united states will not abandon you on this issue .

'' bush said north korea 's recent destruction of a water-cooling tower at its now-defunct nuclear facility and its declaration outlining its plutonium program are positive steps , but there are `` more to be taken . '' lifting sanctions would not weaken the pressure on north korea to be forthcoming on the abduction issue or in nuclear negotiations , the u.s. president said . bush said north korea remains the most sanctioned nation in the world and that `` delisting did not get rid of their sanctions .

'' the mine 's owner had insisted that earth movement detected at the time of the collapse had caused the disaster . but investigators found instead that the collapse caused the earth movement . `` it was not -- and i repeat , it was not -- a natural occurring earthquake , '' said the government 's top mine safety official , richard e. stickler . stickler , the acting assistant secretary of labor for mine safety and health , said , `` pillars failed under excessive load and ejected coal very violently . '' stickler also said the mine 's operator `` was taking more coal than allowed from the barrier pillars and the floor . '' `` this dangerously weakened the strength of the roof support , '' stickler said . in addition to the six miners killed in the initial cave-in august 6 in northwest emery county , three would-be rescuers died 10 days later in a subsequent collapse . the bodies of the six miners killed in the initial collapse were never recovered . richard gates , the lead investigator for the government , said the pillars in the mine `` simply were not large enough to support the load . '' that resulted in a `` catastrophic failure of pillars over a broad area , '' as large as half a mile , he said . university of utah scientists said in june that the collapse was not the result of an earthquake . `` as seismologists , we 're as certain as we can be that the seismic event registered as a magnitude-3 .9 shock was due to the collapse of the mine and not a naturally occurring earthquake , '' said walter arabasz , director of the university 's utah seismograph stations , in a written statement . earlier this year , a labor department report criticized mine safety and health administration officials for approving plans for a risky mining technique , known as retreat mining , that was in use before the collapse . in the process , miners remove pillars of coal that support the roof of a chamber one by one , allowing the roof to collapse behind them . mine owner bob murray repeatedly denied in the days after the disaster that his company practiced retreat mining at crandall canyon . he later admitted that the practice had been used at the mine but said it was not being done at the time of the disaster .

807	new delhi , india -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president george w. bush called india 's prime minister thursday to push a proposed nuclear partnership that sparked an unsuccessful no-confidence vote against the indian leader this week , a white house spokesman said . prime minister manmohan singh won a confidence vote despite opposition to the nuclear deal . `` both leaders expressed their desire to see the u.s.-india civil nuclear issue move forward as expeditiously as possible , '' gordon johndroe said . the phone call took place two days after indian prime minister manmohan singh narrowly survived the no-confidence vote in the lower house of parliament . the vote was sparked by concerns from the opposition that india was kowtowing to the u.s. . the tentative deal was announced in 2006 and signed by bush and singh a year ago . under the agreement , which will need to be approved by the u.s. congress , india would have access to u.s. nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian nuclear power plants . that would happen even though new delhi , which tested nuclear weapons in 1974 and 1998 , has declined to join international non-proliferation agreements . in return , india has promised that it would not transfer the fuel and equipment to its weapons program , and it would allow the international atomic energy agency to inspect at least 14 of its 22 nuclear plants . the plan would also expand u.s.-indian cooperation in energy and satellite technology . the plan was approved by india 's cabinet last year , and does not have to be ratified by the parliament . the leaders of india 's two communist parties -- which hold about 60 seats in parliament -- have accused singh of surrendering india 's sovereignty to the united states with the deal . a no-confidence vote would have forced singh to resign , and required the government to hold early elections unless a new coalition could have been formed . the congress party-led coalition has governed india since 2004 . tuesday 's 275-256 vote was so crucial to the survival of singh 's government that five members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to cast votes -- under the watchful eyes of their jailers . shortly after singh survived the vote , white house spokeswoman dana perino praised the deal as `` a good one for everybody . '' `` it 's good for india because it would help provide them a source for energy that they need , one that is nonpolluting and one that does n't emit greenhouse gas emissions , '' she said . `` and we think that we can move forward with this . if their legislature lets it move forward , then we can do the same here and then we 'll be able to get this wrapped up .

'' iraqi government spokesman ali al-dabbagh and the ministry 's adviser , basil abdul mahdi , are on their way to lausanne , switzerland , to meet with ioc officials , jaffer said . the ioc barred iraq from participating in the olympic summer games in beijing , china , citing what it said was government interference with iraq 's olympic movement . the ioc 's charter does not allow political interference . the ban stems from the iraqi government decision in may to suspend the country 's existing olympic committee and form a new entity . watch an official explain the decision '' but even as government representatives traveled to switzerland , jaffer said iraq was considering legal action against the ioc . `` we will revert to international courts with a complaint against the ioc ... to get iraq 's rights and the rights of the athletes , '' jaffer said . on friday , another iraqi government official said the country was doing what it could to reverse the ban , but acknowledged that `` chances are slim '' for a change . basam ridha al-husseini , an adviser to prime minister nuri al-maliki , told cnn the government has been in `` heavy negotiations '' with ioc officials through the asian olympic committee . `` the iraqi government will not give up on our participation , which is still needed by our people , '' he said in a phone interview from dubai . `` we are doing our best to stop the ban . ... the chances of that are slim , but we will persevere and hope it will happen . '' repeated attempts by cnn to reach the ioc press office in switzerland for comment were unsuccessful . but on thursday , ioc spokeswoman emmanuelle moreau said the ioc in june suspended iraq 's national olympic committee after the government removed elected officials and put in people not recognized by the ioc . she said the ioc had proposed to the iraqi government that officials come to the ioc headquarters in lausanne , switzerland , `` to discuss possible solutions . '' `` we 're extremely disappointed with the situation , '' moreau said . `` the athletes have been ill-served by the government in iraq . '' iraq missed a wednesday deadline for the entry of athletes to compete in archery , judo , rowing and weightlifting , moreau said . she said there is a chance that track and field athletes could compete if the original committee is reinstated . the deadline for the track team to register is at the end of the month . jaffer , iraq 's sports minister , told cnn on friday that the ioc 's decision was `` unjust '' because it did not take into consideration the iraqi government 's reasons for the may suspension . the minister called on the ioc to come to iraq and talk to the sports federation to investigate the political interference accusations , and then act accordingly . `` looking at this from far away , without going into the details , not reading the iraqi government 's reports , not hearing iraq 's side of the story and accusing iraq of many things is really unfortunate , '' he said . several iraqi athletes were to travel to china for the games ' start in august . iraqi sprinter dana hussain cried for hours after hearing the news of the ban on thursday , which arrived in the form of a letter to iraqi officials . `` she has n't stopped . it 's like finding out that a close relative has died , '' said her coach , yousif abdul rahman . abdul rahman attempted to console hussain by assuring her that she could compete in the 2012 olympics . watch hussain react to the news '' `` in this horrible situation , '' she said , `` who can say i 'll even be alive in 2012 ? '' al-husseini said iraq had the right as a sovereign nation to suspend the olympic committee , which he accused of documented corruption . it was not clear where the committee 's funds were going and they `` could be ending up in the hands of terrorists , '' he said . `` we are satisfied with the decision ... stand by it and we are not going to change an order by -lsb- prime minister -rsb- al-maliki and the cabinet . ... never , '' he said . he was asked whether iraq would consider doing what yugoslavia did in the 1992 winter olympics when it was banned -- sending individual athletes and not raising the national flag . al-husseini said that would be an option , but al-maliki rejected it . al-husseini said that iraq had been banned from taking part in the 1990 olympics during the saddam hussein-era because of the invasion of kuwait . the 1990 ban , enacted by the olympic council of asia , actually was a ban on participation in the asian games , a regional olympics-related event . iraq participated in the 1992 olympics in barcelona , the first games held after the kuwait invasion . cnn 's jomana karadsheh and morgan neill contributed to this report .

'' the republicans said they would not prevent the senate from taking up the housing bill passed earlier in the day by the house , although a final vote on that bill is not expected before the end of the week . democrats oppose republican measures to lift bans on offshore drilling and oil exploration in the arctic national wildlife reserve . see how gas prices have risen across the country '' republicans say the process would not be fair unless they can offer all of their amendments . sen. robert menendez , a new jersey democrat , accused the republicans of wanting to score political points rather than pass legislation . `` the problem with our republican colleagues is that they want to debate , not act . ... even when they are offered what they want , they say no . '' menendez suggested there was bipartisan support for measures meant to limit speculation , encourage conservation and provide tax credits for renewable energy . `` why would you not move forward on the items that you have consensus ? '' he asked . the disagreement between republicans and democrats could result in congress leaving washington for its monthlong recess in august without passing any measures to lower gas prices , which are averaging above $ 4 a gallon at the pump . experts have said lifting bans on drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and offshore would not affect the oil market for several years , but republicans have argued that the psychological effect of opening more areas for oil exploration would bring prices down . sen. byron dorgan , d-north dakota , one of the main sponsors of the bill , pleaded for republicans to help `` wring excessive speculation '' from the oil markets . he says speculation is responsible for 71 percent of the increase in a price of a barrel of oil this year . some analysts say speculation has added between $ 40 to $ 60 dollars to a barrel of oil . but other experts have questioned the extent to which speculators -- rather than basic market principles of supply and demand -- have driven up the price of oil . wednesday morning , a barrel of light , sweet crude was priced around $ 128 on the new york mercantile exchange , down from the $ 147 a barrel record set july 11 and the lowest price since june 5 . dorgan said ending speculation in the oil market would be a sensible first step toward lowering gas prices that both sides of the aisle could agree to . republicans `` have come up with a hundred excuses why they do n't want to do that , '' he said . but republicans say they want the opportunity to offer `` real '' solutions that will lower energy prices , which includes more drilling to expand domestic production . see what factors are driving up the price of oil '' `` the republicans know that american people want us to do something real , something big , something important about the price of gasoline , '' said sen. pete dominici , r-new mexico . `` and the only thing that we can do that is important is to release large quantities of crude oil and natural gas that are owned by american people and that have been locked up for 27 years in moratoria . '' dorgan , however , said the republicans are trying to suggest democrats are against additional domestic oil production , noting that there are millions of acres of federally controlled land and off-shore drilling sites that are open to exploration but have not been used by oil companies . `` it 's a false choice that the minority side says we should drill and that the majority side does n't , '' dorgan said . the bill in the senate would provide more resources and authority to the commodities futures trading commission to detect and punish speculation . it would help stop speculators from using foreign markets to manipulate the price of oil in the united states , require more transparency in oil markets and limit the trading of market players who do not intend to receive the oil they purchase . cnn 's ted barrett , debra krajnak and scott anderson contributed to this report .

811	phnom penh , cambodia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- cambodia has sent a letter to the united nations security council to call attention to its continuing standoff with thailand over an ancient border temple on disputed land . cambodian soldiers stand guard near preah vihear temple , close to the thai border . the country is not asking for u.n. intervention , said information minister kheu kanharith . rather , the letter that cambodia 's permanent mission in new york submitted to the chairmen of the security council and the general assembly is meant to draw attention to a crisis that entered its sixth day sunday . the two countries agreed to meet monday to defuse tensions -- even as each side continued to amass more troops to the site of the preah vihear temple . both cambodia and thailand lay claim to the 11th century temple , which sits atop a cliff on cambodian soil but has its most accessible entrance on the thai side . the international court of justice awarded the temple to cambodia in 1962 . thailand claims , however , that the 1.8 square mile -lrb- 4.6 sq. km -rrb- area around it was never fully demarcated . thailand further says that the dispute arose from the fact that the cambodian government used a map drawn during the french occupation of cambodia that places both the temple and the surrounding area in that country 's territory . earlier this month , the united nations approved cambodia 's application to have the temple listed as a world heritage site -- places the u.n. says have outstanding universal value . the decision re-ignited tensions , with some in thailand fearing it will make it difficult for their country to lay claim to disputed land around the temple . opposition parties in thailand used the issue to attack the government , which initially backed the heritage listing . a thai court overturned the pact , prompting the resignation of thailand 's foreign minister , noppadon pattama . he had endorsed the application . cambodia , meanwhile , is preparing for general elections on july 27 . and prime minister hun sen , who has been in power since the mid-1980s , has portrayed the u.n. recognition as a national triumph . the current flare-up began tuesday , when cambodian guards briefly detained three thais who crossed into the area . once they were let go , the three refused to leave the territory . cambodia claims thailand sent troops to retrieve the trio and gradually built up their numbers . thailand denies the charge , saying its troops are deployed in thai territory . each side has asked its troops to withhold fire unless they are fired upon . so far , the only casualty has been a thai soldier who was injured tuesday by a landmine -- possibly left over from the time the khmer rouge occupied the area . the khmer rouge , a radical communist movement that ruled cambodia from 1975 to 1979 , won power through a guerrilla war . it is remembered for the deaths of as many as 1.5 million cambodians . -- journalist soeum yin contributed to this report .
812	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- congress voted to halt planned cuts in medicare payments to doctors tuesday , overriding president bush 's veto in a battle that pitted health insurers against physicians . president bush says he objects to the bill because it takes choices `` away from seniors to pay physicians . '' the new law stops a 10.6 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors , part of a scheduled cost-saving formula that went into effect july 1 . the money for the doctors will be taken from the government-subsidized medicare advantage program , which the bush administration strongly supports . bush spiked the bill tuesday , telling lawmakers they would be `` taking choices away from seniors to pay physicians . '' `` i urge the congress to send me a bill that reduces the growth in medicare spending , increases competition and efficiency , implements principles of value-driven health care and appropriately offsets increases in physician spending , '' he said in his veto message . the senate voted 70-26 to enact the law over bush 's objections , the third time in his presidency that congress has overridden his veto . the margin in the house of representatives was a lopsided 383-41 , well beyond the two-thirds majority needed . the american medical association lobbied heavily for the bill , warning that its members could be forced to curtail seeing medicare patients if the cuts went into effect . but insurers , which receive government subsidies to offer medicare advantage plans , warned that 2 million seniors could lose health benefits if it passed . a total of 21 senate republicans joined 47 democrats and two independents in the override vote . supporters broke a gop-led filibuster of the bill last week , aided by the dramatic return of sen. edward kennedy of massachusetts . kennedy 's vote came in his first appearance on the senate floor since surgery to remove a brain tumor in early june . though he did not vote tuesday , kennedy praised his colleagues for overriding the `` misguided '' veto . `` it 's a great vote , and a great day for america 's seniors , '' he said in a written statement . those republicans who opposed the bill argued that it would roll back many of the changes made to medicare in 2003 , when congress created privately run , government-subsidized prescription drug coverage and expanded the role of private insurers in other coverage . `` these are not pro-patient policies , '' said sen. jon kyl , r-arizona . `` rather , the bill reduces access , benefits and choices for medicare beneficiaries . '' but critics of the 2003 reforms say medicare advantage subsidies end up costing more than the government would pay to cover the same people through regular medicare , the federal health insurance program for seniors . the congressional budget office estimates that the bill will reduce federal spending by $ 12.5 billion by 2013 , largely by reducing medicare advantage enrollment . sen. patty murray , d-washington , said the bill also made `` vital improvements '' by supporting rural health care and lowering fees for mental health care . `` today , we can stand up for medicare , '' she said . `` we did it last week , when we came together and voted for this measure by a veto-proof margin , and i believe we can do it today by overriding that veto . '' congress had passed only two bills over bush 's objections : a $ 23 billion water-project legislation that the president vetoed in 2007 and a $ 300 billion farm bill he spiked in may . the medicare system pays for the health care of roughly 40 million elderly americans . rising health care costs have made medicare a growing part of the federal budget , and the stress on the system is increasing as more baby boomers reach retirement age . while the debate was raging over the bill , the ama said the cuts could lead to a `` meltdown '' of the government 's health care system for the elderly . a recent survey by the group found that 60 percent of physicians will be forced to limit the number of new medicare patients they can take on if the cuts go into effect . `` we stand at the brink of a medicare meltdown . ... for doctors , this is not a partisan issue ; it 's a patient access issue , '' ama president nancy nielsen said in a statement after last week 's senate vote . the ama ran radio and tv ads over the july fourth congressional recess targeting 10 republican senators , seven of whom are up for re-election . the aarp , the nation 's largest organization of retired people , and other groups also are weighing in against the cuts . gerald harmon , a family physician who practices in pawleys island , south carolina , said the cuts could lead to doctors taking fewer medicare patients , making it difficult for the program 's elderly patients to get the care they need . `` this medicare access problem is a real issue , not just a political football , '' said harmon , who said 35 percent of his patients were eligible for medicare . `` it affects your dad when he 's sick . it affects my patients in my practice . this has to be addressed .

'' mrrg : `` a haunting experiment into the human psyche is the only way i can describe the unequivocal depth that ledger was able to reach with this portrayal of one the most evil characters ever brought to the screen . it was definitely bale 's story , but the late heath ledger 's movie . sonnyjc9 : wife and i watched this yesterday 17 july here in bangkok , thailand . heath ledger is awesome as the joker . 154 minutes of pure entertainment , and you will be giggling to yourself from heath 's performance . it is sad to think he will never reprise this role , but what a farewell . must see . zandz : we went to the premiere of this movie last night and thought the movie was only good . however , heath ledger did an excellent job portraying the the joker . the way heath ledger plays the joker is different than how jack nicholson plays the character . both have their unique styles -- nicholson 's joker was more comical , but ledger 's was more dark -lrb- while trying to be funny -rrb- . the makeup artists also did a great job on this joker 's face .

818	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the united states needs a new law requiring that the president consult with congress before going to war , a blue-ribbon panel led by two former secretaries of state said tuesday . james baker , left , and warren christopher led a panel that recommended a new war powers act . the current war powers resolution is `` ineffective , and it should be repealed and it should be replaced , '' james baker said in a joint appearance with warren christopher , announcing the results of the study they led . the recommendation follows failed efforts by democrats in congress to put a stop to the war in iraq or to put conditions on president bush 's conduct of it . congress passed a joint resolution to authorize armed force against iraq in 2002 , but some bush opponents say it should not have been interpreted as a blank check for the united states to invade and occupy the persian gulf nation . baker , who served in george h.w. bush 's administration , and christopher , who served under president bill clinton , said their project was not prompted by any specific war , with christopher adding that the commission had `` tried very hard not to call balls and strikes on past history here . '' `` we did n't direct this report at any particular conflict , '' baker added . the existing law , the war powers resolution of 1973 , has been regarded as unconstitutional by every president since it was passed as a response to the vietnam war , baker and christopher said . it requires presidents to report regularly to congress about ongoing conflicts , but the provision has been flouted . `` no president has ever made a submission to congress pursuant to the war powers resolution since 1973 , '' former sen. slade gorton , a republican member of the committee , said tuesday . the panel , formally called the national war powers commission , said a new law should be created requiring the president to consult with key members of congress before sending troops into combat expected to last more than a week , or within three days of doing so in the case of operations that need to be kept secret . it should also make clear exactly who the president needed to consult . the panel suggests that the president talk to `` a joint congressional committee made up of the leaders of the house and the senate as well as the chairmen and ranking members of key committees . '' the new committee would have a permanent professional staff with access to intelligence information , baker and christopher said . congress , in turn , would have to declare war or vote on a `` resolution of approval '' within 30 days , they said . if a resolution of approval failed , any member of congress could introduce a `` resolution of disapproval , '' but it was not clear that such an act would stop a war in progress . christopher was unable to say in the news conference what practical effect congressional disapproval would have . baker said the commission had been in touch with the presidential campaigns of democrat barack obama and republican john mccain , as well as leaders of congress . he declined to reveal what they thought of the proposal , but said : `` we have n't gotten a negative reaction . '' congress has not officially declared war since 1942 , when the united states entered formal hostilities with the axis powers in world war ii . but since then , presidents have sent troops into countries including korea , vietnam , grenada and iraq . the constitution makes the president the commander in chief of the armed forces , but gives congress the power to declare war and approve military budgets . baker and christopher 's group included both republicans and democrats and held seven meetings over 14 months .
819	srinagar , indian-controlled kashmir -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- senior pakistani and indian military officials met tuesday to discuss a border clash in kashmir , the first major skirmish between south asia 's nuclear rivals since a 2003 cease-fire . indian army soldiers on the outskirts of kashmir 's summer capital srinagar . pakistan 's army spokesman maj. gen. athar abbas told cnn that pakistan `` made our point clear '' regarding the firefight , which he said began after indian soldiers crossed the line of control that separates kashmir between india and pakistan . but an indian military spokeswoman , capt. neha goyal , told cnn pakistani troops crossed the line of control and `` started firing on our patrol , '' killing an indian soldier . `` our troops also retaliated and the pakistan army troopers ran back , '' she said . abbas said `` further action should be taken '' following tuesday 's `` flag meeting , '' but did not elaborate . the meeting took place along the line of control . reports in india 's media said four pakistani soldiers were killed , but pakistan 's military `` strongly denied the report of any -lrb- casualties -rrb- on the pakistani side . '' pakistan 's military also denied its forces crossed the line of control , saying the skirmish started when indian soldiers tried to establish a forward post on pakistan 's side of the line . `` on pakistan 's ' objection , indian troops opened indiscriminate and unprovoked fire , '' a pakistan military news release , posted on monday , stated . `` the indian fire was immediately responded to . the firing continued -- intermittently during the whole night . '' pakistan said the indian soldiers `` were forced to flee from the area leaving behind their weapons '' after the firefight . indian and pakistani forces have exchanged periodic gunfire since may , but monday 's clashes appear to be a serious setback to the ongoing peace process between the two nations . india and pakistan had announced a bilateral cease-fire all along their borders in november 2003 and the cease-fire had been holding on the borders until recently . kashmir has been at the root of two wars between india and pakistan , both of which tested nuclear weapons in 1998 . an 18-year separatist campaign in the indian-controlled portion of the largely muslim territory has claimed more than 43,000 lives , according to government officials , although human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations put the toll at twice that number . india has long accused pakistan of supporting the separatists in kashmir , a charge pakistan denies . india blamed militants from pakistan for a suicide car bombing outside its embassy in afghanistan that killed 58 people on july 7 . a december 2001 attack on india 's parliament that india blamed on the militants brought the two nations to the brink of another war , but they have expanded economic and cultural ties since the november 2003 cease-fire agreement . -- cnn 's aliza kassim in atlanta and mukhtar ahmad in srinagar contributed to this report .
820	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.s. army 's official history of the iraq war shows military chiefs made mistake after mistake in the early months of the conflict . iraqis watch as a statue of saddam hussein is toppled in baghdad in 2003 . failures to recognize the chaos engulfing the country and to send in enough troops to restore order after the 2003 invasion have long been highlighted by critics , but a new report shows the army assessing itself . frank opinions from officers serving in the 18 months from the start of war to iraqi elections in january 2005 reveal there were concerns at the time , not just about assumptions made by planners but at decisions taken once u.s.-led coalition forces had control of iraq . `` i flipped , '' gen. jack keane , then the army 's deputy chief of staff , told the historians of his reaction to a june 2003 decision to transfer control of all coalition troops away from the land forces command that had been preparing for the mission . he recounted a conversation with gen. john abizaid , who succeeded the invasion 's architect , gen. tommy franks . `` i said , ` jesus christ , john , this is a recipe for disaster . we invested in that headquarters . we have the experience and judgment in that headquarters . '' keane said it took the u.s. command between six and eight months to get the new headquarters up and running . during that time , troops in the field saw the mood of ordinary iraqis turn against americans and watched the insurgency take root . `` by the time we got a plan together to resource everything , the insurgents had closed that window of opportunity quickly , '' col. david perkins , a brigade commander in the army 's 3rd infantry division , told the historians . `` what we started doing in september was probably a good idea to have done in april 2003 . '' franks , who would soon retire and be awarded the presidential medal of freedom , said he ordered the transition to force the pentagon to get leaders into the field to work with civilian occupation officials . `` that is a task that john abizaid and i very simply laid on washington and said , ` figure it out . do it fast . get me a joint headquarters in here . we have a lot of work to do and -lsb- civilian administrator of iraq -rsb- jerry bremer has a lot of responsibility and he needs help , ' '' he recalled . the 720-page report compiled by the combat studies institute at fort leavenworth , kansas , details the effects of having too few coalition troops on the ground when the reality after the fall of baghdad was `` severely out of line '' with the anticipated conditions . previous experience `` should have indicated that many more troops would be needed for the post-saddam era in iraq , '' historians wrote in the report , `` on point ii : transition to a new campaign . '' `` the coalition 's inability to prevent looting , to secure iraq 's borders and to guard the vast number of munitions dumps in the early months after saddam 's overthrow are indicative of the shortage , '' the study found . about 150,000 u.s. and allied troops were in iraq after the invasion , at a time when war planners were assuming that iraq 's government would remain functional after hussein 's ouster and that there would be no mass insurgency . `` these factors were in line with prewar planning for a quick turnover of power to iraqis and a quick withdrawal of u.s. forces , leaving iraqis to determine their own political future -- options that proved impossible to execute , '' the historians wrote in the report released over the weekend . `` we had the wrong assumptions , and therefore , we had the wrong plan to put into play , '' gen. william wallace , who commanded the army 's v corps during the invasion , told the authors . but some of the most critical decisions were made between may and august 2003 , which some participants called a `` window of opportunity that could have been exploited to produce the conditions for the quick creation of a new iraq . '' among those decisions were the frequently criticized dissolution of the iraqi army and the order that barred former members of hussein 's baath party from public life as well as the change in plan over the joint headquarters .
821	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a virginia judge on tuesday approved an $ 11 million settlement from the state to the families of victims killed or injured in last year 's virginia tech shootings . parents of wounded virginia tech students comfort each other on tuesday . the 24 victims included in the settlement were among the 32 killed by seung-hui cho 's april 16 , 2007 , shooting rampage . the settlement also compensates 18 people injured . `` the commonwealth has endeavored to meet the needs and concerns of the victims , including family members , through both monetary and non-monetary provisions , '' said chief deputy attorney general william c. mims . of the remaining eight deceased victims , families of two chose not to file claims and two other claims are unresolved . the other four will be brought forward at a later date , mims said . the settlement also includes provisions that allow the families to occasionally meet with the governor and virginia tech officials to review legislation and improvements made at the campus in response to the tragedy . the families had pursued wrongful death and personal injury claims against the state after an august 2007 report by an independent panel concluded that more timely and more specific information from university officials might have saved lives . university officials were criticized for not immediately warning students and staff after two students were found dead in a dormitory at 7 a.m. on the day of the killings . police said they initially believed the two had been involved in a romantic dispute , but later determined they were cho 's first victims . it was almost 9:30 a.m. before authorities sent an e-mail to students and staff notifying them of the shootings and warning them to be cautious . about 9:50 a.m. , cho , 23 , began shooting people in norris hall , an engineering and classroom building . while criticizing the university response , the panel -- which included former homeland security secretary tom ridge -- also said quicker action by school officials may not have made a difference . the report also noted that campus and state agencies might have taken a different approach to cho had his middle - and high-school records followed him to virginia tech . problems with cho reportedly began to surface well before the shootings . the records detailed his mental health issues , including a tendency to react to depression with violence .
822	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the inspector-general of the house of representatives will investigate recent allegations of sexual misconduct among congressional pages , the democratic and republican leaders of the chamber announced . the house page program came under scrutiny after the mark foley scandal last year . two pages -- usually high school juniors who serve congress as messengers -- have been dismissed for allegedly having oral sex in public areas of their capitol hill dormitory . `` it was n't kissing and hugging -- let me put it that way , '' said rep. ginny brown-waite , r-florida , last week . `` it did go beyond that . there were not only a young male and female involved , but there were also observers and other page participants who were , let 's say , enablers .

824	copenhagen , denamrk -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- what makes someone decide to become an actor ? it sometimes seems as if the average hollywood star is motivated mainly by the promise of a fat pay check . connie nielsen shot to fame playing lucilla in `` gladiator . '' or perhaps they 're drawn to the celebrity lifestyle . maybe they crave the love of an adoring public , or perhaps they see the movies as a way to leave their mark on the world , to be immortalized on celluloid . for danish actress connie nielsen it was something quite different . for her , being an actor means being an outsider . `` as an artist you actually do have to make a choice to be an outsider . if you 're an outsider you have the freedom to say what people on the inside do n't dare to say , '' she told cnn . so connie nielsen is not your typical movie star . as a 5-foot-10-inch blonde scandinavian beauty she has the looks of a classic silver screen siren , but she has steadfastly resisted a career as hollywood eye candy and rejected the lifestyle that goes with it . `` i absolutely refuse the fame part of my business , '' she says . `` i refuse even the money side of my business . i try to do as good work as i can do , i try to grow in my art and reach for truth , '' she says . raised in elling , a small coastal village in denmark , she is fluent in seven languages and studied acting in france and italy , making her screen debut in french comedy `` par où t'es rentré ? on t ' a pas vu sortir '' -lrb- u.s. title `` how did you get in ? we did n't see you leave '' -rrb- in 1984 . she appeared in more french and italian movies before landing a role opposite al pacino and keanu reeves in `` the devil 's advocate '' in 1997 . but it was n't until 2000 , when she was cast in ridley scott 's oscar-winning `` gladiator '' , that nielsen landed a role that really let her show her acting ability . as lucilla , the sister of the villainous emperor commodus , nielsen brought some much-needed subtlety to the swords-and-sandals epic and held her own sharing the screen with joaquin phoenix and russell crowe . the movie made nielsen an international star and she scored other successes with `` one hour photo '' in 2002 , and `` the hunted '' in 2003 . but while the success of `` gladiator '' opened doors for her , it also meant she had to fight the kind of typecasting that would try to limit her to playing `` the love interest '' to a male lead who got all the good lines . nielsen has in the past been critical of hollywood for its lack of female roles , saying `` you think once you 've shown what you can do , and your movies have been successful , that snap , you work . so to discover the difference between guys ' roles and girls ' roles made me plain mad . it 's unjust . '' but nielsen has refused to be pigeonholed , seemingly drawn to difficult roles in controversial movies . she appeared in french movie `` demonlover '' , which dealt with pornography , violence and corporate amorality , while more recent films have taken on the wars in afghanistan and iraq . danish drama `` brødre '' -lrb- u.s. title `` brothers '' -rrb- is about a soldier who returns from afghanistan a broken man , unable to communicate his experiences from the conflict . playing his wife , nielsen put in a powerful performance that won her awards and served to highlight how hollywood had underused her talents . `` the situation '' in 2006 was billed as the first film to be made about the iraq war and told the story of ordinary iraqis caught up in the conflict , while `` battle of seattle '' examined how peaceful protests erupted into riots when the world trade organization met in seattle in 1999 . of her choice of subject matter , nielsen says that rather than making a political point she is trying to show the human aspects of the conflicts . but nielsen makes it clear that her career is not the focus of her life and she stresses the importance of making time outside the movies . she is passionate about literature and art and she is currently dating lars ulrich , drummer of rock group metallica . she had a son with him in 2007 and has another son from a previous relationship . `` i will always find something that i want to try and become better at . i always love to spend more time with my friends , more time with my family , my extended family . i always want to read more books , '' she says . perhaps her commitment to her art , her interest in social issues and her disavowal of fame simply reflect her danish upbringing , but there 's no doubt that compared to many other hollywood stars connie nielsen is a breath of fresh air .

826	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a magnitude-5 .4 earthquake shook the los angeles metropolitan area tuesday , leaving residents rattled but causing no serious damage or injuries . bricks and other debris clutter an alleyway in pomona , near los angeles tuesday afternoon . however , the temblor served as a warning to southern californians who had not experienced an earthquake in some time : the `` big one '' remains a possibility . `` this is a sample , a small sample , '' said kate hutton , a seismologist at the california institute of technology . `` this is somewhere between small and moderate . '' she said there is a 5 percent chance the quake could be a precursor to a larger earthquake . after 24 hours , she said , that chance will drop to 1 percent . `` every earthquake relieves some stress , '' hutton said . `` it 's usually only a drop in the ocean . in other words , the amount of stress released by this earthquake is minuscule compared to the amount that 's built up and is building up for the big one when it happens some day in the future . '' watch hutton say tuesday 's quake was a sign of bigger ones to come '' and when will that be ? `` from a geologist 's point of view , the answer has to be soon , '' she said . `` but geologists are used to thinking on millions of years and thousands of years time scale , so i do n't think that gives any useful information for people , except be prepared at any time because it could happen at any time . '' a 5.4 magnitude quake is considered by the usgs to be `` moderate , '' which can cause slight damage to buildings and others structures . so far this year , 39 `` moderate '' earthquakes of between magnitude 5.0 and 5.9 have occurred in the united states , and 790 globally . the last moderate quake to strike california was a magnitude 5.4 in april in the northern part of the state . a magnitude 4.4 struck the greater los angeles area in august 2007 . there is a 99 percent chance of california experiencing a quake of magnitude 6.7 or larger within the next 30 years , according to the uniform california earthquake rupture forecast , sponsored by the u.s. geological survey , the california geological survey and the southern california earthquake center and published in science daily in april . `` this earthquake reminds us to be prepared , '' said california gov. arnold schwarzenegger . `` we were very fortunate that there were no serious injuries or property damage . '' he said he believes the state is `` as prepared as anyone can be . we have continuous discussions about that . we are fanatics about emergencies and to be ready . '' the largest earthquake in recent years in california was a magnitude 7.1 in 1999 , hutton said . but it was centered in the desert , near twentynine palms , in a sparsely populated area . tuesday 's quake struck about 11:42 a.m. , according to the usgs . its epicenter was about 2 miles southwest of chino hills and about 5 miles southeast of diamond bar . the epicenter was about 7.6 miles deep , making it a fairly shallow quake , according to cnn meteorologist chad meyers . in general , earthquakes centered closer to the surface produce stronger shaking and can cause more damage than those further underground . but most southern california earthquakes tend to be fairly shallow , officials said . more than 30 aftershocks were recorded . hutton said the largest was a magnitude 3.6 . los angeles police said a downtown hotel sustained some structural damage , but no one was injured and the building was not evacuated . there were some unconfirmed reports of minor injuries . the white house was also monitoring the situation , said spokeswoman dana perino . despite the absence of serious damage or injuries , some los angeles-area residents were left rattled . the quake was felt as far south as san diego , california , and the usgs said it received reports of light shaking as far north as rosamond , california , about 55 miles north-northeast of los angeles . reports from those who felt the quake poured into cnn . did you feel the quake ? `` my house was like a fun house . everything was moving , '' said danny casler , 28 , of huntington beach . he said he was sleeping when his house began shaking , and some things fell in the living room . he said he ran out of the house in his boxer shorts . attorney kevin crisp said he was on the phone with his law partner in riverside , 65 miles away , who burst out , `` big quake ! '' crisp said he felt it about five seconds later . `` this was very impressive . long and very uniform . really had the building going . '' he said doors were swinging on the hinges and bottles of wine were rolling back and forth on his shelf . `` it just started with a really strong jolt , '' said wendy criner . `` i ran and got my daughters from different rooms , and we squatted in the living room . i did have stuff fall off the shelf , some books in my daughters ' room and some things in the kitchen . '' the quake knocked out a ground radar system at los angeles international airport , but that has not interfered with operations , according to the federal aviation administration . technicians were working to restore the system , which helps controllers monitor traffic on the ground . also , tiles fell from the ceiling in one terminal as water flowed from a burst pipe . the calculation of the quake 's magnitude fluctuated as seismologists reviewed the data . initially classified as a magnitude 5.8 , the quake 's intensity was reduced to a 5.6 and then to a 5.4 . because the earthquake magnitude scale is exponential , a 5.8 magnitude quake is four to five times more intense than a 5.4 . two nuclear plants are in the vicinity of the quake 's epicenter near chino hills , according to the nuclear regulatory commission . the closest to the epicenter is in san onofre , 50 miles south , but an nrc spokesman said , `` this is well below the threshold for any conceivable damage to the plants . '' `` in the u.s. particularly in california , buildings are generally built well enough that it takes about a 5.5 for there to be some damage , so we do have the potential for damage , '' said don blakeman , an analyst for the usgs . `` it depends on the structures -lsb- and -rsb- the ground the building is built on . '' he said he would expect objects to be knocked from shelves and some windows broken . `` it 's kind of on the margin where you 'll get some structural damage from these . we may find that some of the older homes and buildings that were n't retrofitted suffer more damage than the newer structures . `` i would expect some cracked buildings , '' he said . `` there is the potential for injuries , but hopefully we wo n't have too much of that . '' blakeman 's comments came before the quake 's magnitude was dropped to a 5.4 . however , he said afterward that the change does not affect his expectations , although obviously there is less potential for damage . still , the quake jolted the nerves of many californians . `` i 've lived in california , i 've lived through several of them , '' margot wagner of santa barbara told cnn . `` it 's always a little unnerving .

'' `` this review resulted in fmcsa placing angel tours ' operations out of service , '' hill said . `` to date , angel tours has not provided the agency with evidence of satisfactory corrective actions to the problems discovered and remains out of service . '' in addition , `` fmcsa has not granted iguala busmex authority to transport passengers because it has failed to fully comply with federal safety requirements . '' he said police have been asked to stop any of the companies ' buses . both companies are owned by angel de la torre . a man who answered the phone at angel tours office said the owner was meeting with his lawyers and was unavailable . massage therapist leha nguyen , 45 , was a passenger . she was traveling by herself on the bus when she departed houston at 8:30 p.m. thursday for what was to have been her fourth trip to carthage , missouri . after sandwiches were passed around , the group said prayers , and nguyen began to drift off to sleep in her window seat next to an older woman , four rows behind the driver , she said . ireport.com : were you there ? send photos , video . about 11:45 p.m. , the bus passed dallas , `` and as soon as we passed dallas we were on the two-way freeway and i feel the bus ride a little bit fast and i have a feeling , not a safe feeling , '' she said . she added , `` i feel a little bit shaky , but i just let myself at peace and then go to sleep .

832	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- radovan karadzic , whose interpol charges listed `` flamboyant behavior '' as a distinguishing characteristic , was a practicing psychiatrist who came to be nicknamed the `` butcher of bosnia . '' twice indicted in 1995 by the u.n. international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia , karadzic faces charges of genocide , complicity in genocide , extermination , murder , willful killing , persecutions , deportation , inhumane acts , terror against civilians and hostage-taking . while president of the so-called serbian republic of bosnia-herzegovina , karadzic 's troops were reported to have massacred over hundreds of thousands of muslims and croats during a campaign of `` ethnic cleansing . '' early estimates of the death toll from the 3-year war ranged up to 300,000 , but recent research reduced that to about 100,000 . the u.s. state department had a $ 5 million reward for information leading to his capture . his arrest brings an end to more than 10 years as a fugitive . watch cnn 's chief international correspondent christiane amanpour report on karadzic 's rise and fall '' karadzic was born on june 19 , 1945 , in petnjica , montenegro . he studied psychiatry and medicine at the university of sarajevo during the 1960s and took courses in psychiatry and poetry at columbia university from 1974 to 1975 . karadzic , a serb-croat , in 1990 helped found the serbian democratic party -lrb- sds -rrb- , a party aimed at unifying serbs into a common state , and became its president . two years later , he became president of the newly declared serbian republic of bosnia and herzegovina , later called `` republika srpska . '' during the next three years , he ordered bosnian serb forces to seize the majority of bosnia and herzegovina . he also announced , according to his u.n. indictment , six `` strategic objectives '' for the serbian people . they included the establishment of state borders between the serbs and the other two ethnic communities , bosnian muslims and bosnian croats . answering to him , according to the indictment , was bosnian serb military commander ratko mladic . from may 1992 , the indictment alleged , bosnian serb forces under mladic 's command targeted civilian areas of sarajevo with shelling and sniping during a three-year conflict within the city . in july 1995 , according to the u.n. indictment , troops under mladic 's command executed an estimated 7,000 bosnian muslim male prisoners in srebrenica , a u.n. safe area , and then participated in a comprehensive effort to conceal the killings . the massacre is considered the worst in europe since world war ii . the indictment states that bosnian serb forces acted under karadzic 's direction and worked to `` significantly reduce the bosnian muslim , bosnian croat and other non-serb populations '' in municipalities that were seized . karadzic was last seen in public in september 1996 , a year after the dayton peace accords brought a formal end to the conflict and banned anyone accused of war crimes , including him , from office . he reportedly shaved his trademark bushy hair , grew a beard and donned priest 's robes , moving from monastery to monastery in the mountains to avoid capture . cnn correspondent alessio vinci said : `` he enjoyed protection from the local population , wherever he was hiding . legend has it he disguised himself as a priest to take part in his mother 's funeral . `` in 2002 , after nato launched one of its many failed raids to try to arrest karadzic in bosnia , i interviewed his mother . at that time she said : ` serbs are righteous people and i can see that they support him , and that they adore him the way he is . they would lose their lives to protect him .

'' aol autos : consumer reports on best fuel-efficient used cars . why so expensive in california ? marie montgomery , spokeswoman for the automobile club of southern california , says the primary reason behind the high price of gas in california is `` market segmentation , '' a marketing term that basically means california -lrb- along with many other states -rrb- has developed a `` boutique blend '' of fuel in a bid to uphold environmental or ecological standards . in california 's case , this blend helps clear the state 's notorious smog . `` we ca n't use gas they made for iowa . we use a special blend with additives in it , an ethanol mix , '' montgomery said . `` when you do that , you can only use refineries that make that gas -lsb- mix -rsb- . the refineries in california are a major supplier , but , when prices are high and there 's not another supplier , we have to go where they make that mix . '' she pointed out that refineries in oregon and washington produce the gas product , and there is a pipeline to alaska , but that the only other options are shipping in the blend from elsewhere in the nation or asia , which is not cost-efficient . `` people have to figure out how to deal with this on a long-term basis . we 've been telling motorists to carpool and here we are in summer , and prices have barely come down , '' she said . `` usually we 're about a month into a downturn , it 's cyclical : prices go up in spring and spike in may , which is n't happening this year . prices may not come down a lot . '' less misery in missouri . michael right , vice president of public affairs for aaa missouri , said his state is usually among the top three in terms of low gas prices . a contributing factor , he said , is that the state 's per-gallon tax rate is the lowest in the nation . he said that most , if not all , states impose a tax on gasoline but few are as low as the 17 cents a gallon missouri levies . and missouri , unlike most other states , does n't impose a sales tax on top of that . the state also benefits from good distribution via a crisscrossing network of pipelines which can , unusually , result in cheaper gas in rural areas than in major cities . the reason for this is the three types of gas used in the state . st louis primarily uses reformulated gasoline . conventional gas is sold in rural areas , and kansas city uses low rvp -lrb- or low-emission -rrb- gasoline . reformulated costs more than conventional gas , hence the higher cost in cities . `` in illinois , it 's not unusual to save 15 cents a gallon by crossing the river , '' right said . aol autos : best hybrid suvs . effects on station owners and operators . while the effects of soaring pump prices on consumers are well documented , owners and operators of service stations nationwide are also feeling the pain acutely . dennis decota , the executive director of the 135-year-old california service station and automotive repair association and owner of a service station in marin county , california , said high prices are `` extremely detrimental to business people . what it does is creates a financial hardship on customers , -lsb- leading to -rsb- less foot traffic to stores or repair facilities . it puts a strain on entire businesses ; unbranded service stations are really at the end of their rope . '' independent , unbranded stations have one retail philosophy : offer the best price . they rely on oversupply by refineries which they buy at wholesale prices and sell cheaper than the branded competition , like shell or exxon -lrb- which have both announced they are quitting the service-station industry -rrb- . but in the past six months , that supply curve has become inverted , which means owner-operators are paying more -- $ 37,000 a truckload -- for their gas than branded outlets . decota noted some are losing as much as 15 cents a gallon on every sale . it 's a hard time for the industry , he said . the blame for high oil prices is pretty evenly spread , decota said . he did , however , point out that as a result of higher gas prices , california brought in $ 4.4 billion last year in sales taxes from its monthly sales of 1,300,000,000 gallons . in 2002 , when gas prices averaged about $ 1.71 a gallon , it brought in $ 1.7 billion . decota advocates boosting refinery capacity from its current level of 88 percent to about 92 percent . he said refineries `` have their hands on the spigot . there is no shortage of crude . but if the government stepped up refinery capacity , that would put enough downward pressure to create competition among refineries . and my guys are going under .

'' the crisis in georgia started friday , when russia moved troops in into south ossetia after the georgian government moved troops into breakaway territory . south ossetia has been largely autonomous since 1991 , but separatists would like to break with georgia and either declare independence or join north ossetia , which is part of russia . secretary of state condoleezza rice , who is heading to france and the georgian capitol of tbilisi , said wednesday that she has been briefing both candidates on the conflict . watch president bush declare ` america 's unwavering support ' for georgia '' when the crisis began last week , mccain , the presumptive republican presidential nominee , was out front in condemning the russia actions and calling for a cease-fire . `` today , we are all georgians , '' mccain said tuesday . watch mccain declare ` we are all georgians ' '' when the crisis broke out last week , the obama camp called `` for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict , '' echoing the statements from the white house and the european union . as russia planes bombed georgian cities and russian troops advanced into georgia , obama , who is on vacation in hawaii , condemned russia 's actions and called for a cease-fire . watch obama condemn russia 's actions '' mccain said wednesday that the crisis was not the time for partisan attacks . `` i know the people of georgia have enjoyed an unprecedented period of prosperity and freedom . and i know that at this time they 're suffering mightily , '' the arizona republican said . `` so maybe later on in the campaign , let 's have a back-and-forth about who has comments or statements . now , let 's devote all our energy to helping resolve a situation which is fraught with human tragedy . '' but , despite mccain comments , the crisis in georgia has dominated the political debate between the two candidates ' campaigns in recent days . on tuesday , randy scheunemann , mccain 's top foreign policy adviser , attacked the presumptive democratic presidential nominee 's response to the situation in georgia , saying his experience with the region amounted to a handful of paper statements . on the other hand , mccain 's experience with georgia runs deep , scheunemann said , noting that mccain and the georgian president were friends . `` there 's a depth of knowledge , a breadth of knowledge and an extent of historical experience that does n't compare between the two on russia policy , '' scheunemann said . `` you ca n't compare a 15-year historical record to three or four statements over the course of 15 months . '' but susan rice , obama 's senior foreign policy adviser , said tuesday that mccain 's comments condemning russia `` may or may not have complicated the situation . '' `` we can not shoot from the hip , '' rice told msnbc on tuesday . `` we can not act on the basis of ideology or preconceived notions . when this crisis began , barack obama , the administration ... and all of our nato allies took a measured and reasoned approach because we were dealing with the facts as we knew them . '' mccain spokesman tucker bounds said wednesday that his campaign was disappointed that rice had launched `` inflammatory and baseless '' political attacks `` during an international crisis when bipartisanship is needed most . '' in response , hari sevugan , a spokesman for the obama , said it was `` the absolute height of hypocrisy '' for the mccain campaign to `` play the victim '' after attacking obama 's `` strong and appropriate '' position on georgia . bill schneider , a cnn senior political analyst , said mccain could use the situation in georgia to highlight one his inherent advantages over obama : his experience . but mccain 's strong position in defiance of russia also has risks , schneider said . `` some voters may worry : does he want to start a new cold war ? the risk for mccain is that he could overplay the issue and frighten war-weary voters whose priorities right now lie closer to home , '' schneider said . cnn 's peter hamby contributed to this report .

841	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a slim majority of americans think churches should stay out of politics , according to a new survey . john mccain , the rev. rick warren and barack obama together for a cnn broadcast forum on faith . the survey suggests that for the first time in more than a decade , there has been a shift away from the view that religious groups should influence social and political issues . fifty-two percent of poll respondents said churches should stay quiet , while 46 percent said churches should express political views . the biggest shift has come among republicans , one of the authors of the poll said . `` overall , the number of people who say churches should not endorse political candidates is up slightly , but among republicans it is up 11 points , and among white evangelical republicans it is up 19 points , '' said greg smith , a research fellow at the pew forum on religion & public life . `` there is a slight uptick , from 40 percent to 46 percent , among people who are uncomfortable to have politicians talking about religion , but it is up 10 points among republicans , '' he added . four years ago , seven out of 10 conservatives approved of religious institutions expressing political views . but five out of 10 conservatives in thursday 's poll said it was appropriate . it seems that the more important social issues are to conservatives , the more likely they were to say that religion and politics should not mix . among people who said gay marriage was a very important issue , the number saying houses of worship should keep out of politics doubled , from 25 percent to 50 percent . among those who said it was not important , the number was essentially unchanged . respondents were also more likely to say houses of worship should not meddle in politics if they considered the major political parties to be hostile to religion . the new figures bring republican views into line with those of democrats and independents . a 14-point gap between republican and democratic views on the subject in august 2004 fell to one point in the new survey . but smith cautioned against reading the survey to mean basic conservative philosophy was changing . `` it appears to be frustration with the contemporary political landscape more than an underlying philosophical shift , '' he said . `` it is not the case the conservatives are uncomfortable with a political role for religion , but we do see increasing discomfort with churches getting involved with politics . '' `` voting intentions among white evangelicals have not changed at all , '' smith added . republican candidate sen. john mccain `` has a huge lead even among younger evangelicals . '' but social conservatives are lukewarm about mccain as compared to president bush . nearly seven out of 10 white evangelical protestants and conservatives said they supported mccain ; the number was slightly higher for bush in august 2004 . but four years ago , 57 percent of them said they backed bush strongly . the number is 28 percent for mccain this year , with 40 percent saying they backed him , but not strongly . the number of people who think religious groups have too much influence over political parties grew -- for both republicans and democrats -- as did the percentage of people who are uncomfortable hearing politicians talk about how religious they are . americans continue to see the republican party as more friendly to religion than the democrats , although the democrats closed the gap somewhat since reaching a low point in 2006 . other survey results showed little change from the past . two out of three americans continue to say churches should not endorse candidates for president , and most still feel a president should have strong religious beliefs . the survey was conducted by the pew research center for people & the press and the pew forum on religion & public life by interviewing 2,905 adults nationwide by phone between july 31 and august 10 . on saturday , obama and mccain answered questions that had religious overtones at a forum hosted by the rev. rick warren . the pastor of southern california 's saddleback church is author of the best-selling book `` the purpose-driven life . '' asked when life begins , mccain was quick to say `` at the moment of conception . '' mccain 's response was met with huge applause from the audience . `` i have a 25-year pro-life record in the congress , in the senate , and as president of the united states , i will be a pro-life president , and this presidency will have pro-life policies , '' he said . when obama was asked about when life begins , the pro-choice candidate said that decision is `` above my pay grade . '' the response garnered criticism from liberal and conservative thinkers who said obama tried to dodge the issue . obama said although he 's pro-choice and supports a woman 's right to abortion , his goal is to reduce the number of abortions in america . `` on this particular issue , if you believe that life begins at conception ... and you are consistent , then i ca n't argue with you on that , '' he said . `` what i can do is say , ` are there ways we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies ?

844	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the united states and britain praised pakistani president pervez musharraf 's contribution to the war on terror while the bush administration claimed no role in the leader 's resignation monday . pakistan 's pervez musharraf has until now stubbornly resisted pressure to quit . a senior state department official familiar with the situation told cnn u.s. officials were in touch with musharraf in the week leading up to the resignation . however , the official said , the united states made it clear that it would not get involved in the struggle between musharraf and the newly elected pakistani parliament . `` if he made a decision to go , or fight against it -- we did n't advise him either way , '' the official said . `` we really did keep our fingers out of this one . '' musharraf is viewed as a keen ally of the west in the fight on terror , receiving billions in military aid from both and launching attacks on militant groups near the country 's border with afghanistan . watch musharraf resign '' `` president musharraf has been a friend to the united states and one of the world 's most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism , '' said secretary of state condoleezza rice after musharraf 's announcement . `` we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistan 's future and its most urgent needs , including stemming the growth of extremism , addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability , '' she added . `` the united states will help with these efforts to see pakistan reach its goal of becoming a stable , prosperous , democratic , modern , muslim nation . '' the bush administration 's main priority is a crackdown on taliban and al qaeda militants in pakistan 's tribal regions . the administration believes pakistan 's intelligence service is full of al qaeda and taliban loyalists , an accusation pakistan denies . view a timeline of musharraf 's time in power '' `` there is a great deal of frustration on the part of the u.s. government with pakistan 's inability to follow through on what the u.s. sees as its clear commitments , '' said robert grenier , a former cia counterterrorism official , now a managing director at risk consultation firm kroll . `` it remains very much to be seen whether this new democratically-elected leadership will really be able to follow through in a sustained and coherent way , '' he said . `` they have n't demonstrated an ability to do that . '' the united states has stepped up missile strikes inside pakistan , killing dozens of militants , and head of the army , gen. ashfaq kiyani , is now the united states ' closest ally in power . but some experts warn that u.s. pressure could go too far . `` the u.s. military has to be extremely cautious , '' said rick barton , a director and adviser with the non-profit center for strategic and international studies who is a former u.n. and u.s. official . `` it could actually be setting the torch to the kindling inside the country . '' musharraf told the nation in a televised address monday that he would step down -- nearly nine years after he seized power in a bloodless coup in 1999 . `` i do n't want the people of pakistan to slide deeper and deeper into uncertainty , '' he said . until now , musharraf , 65 , had stubbornly resisted pressure to resign . but his once-considerable power eroded significantly since february 's election that pushed his party out of power . that pressure increased in the past few weeks as the new ruling party began making plans to impeach him . only time will tell whether the power shift will benefit pakistan , but `` it puts a lot more responsibility squarely on the government . there is no more excuse any more . they have to stand up and do things . they ca n't blame musharraf , '' the state department official said . the official said musharraf is n't expected to try to undermine the government . `` i really do n't think he has been a factor for six months , '' the official said . `` he has n't been able to do that while he was in the presidency , and he wo n't be as well-positioned -lsb- out of the presidency -rsb- to interfere .

'' `` president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic , political and security challenges they face . '' british foreign secretary david miliband said it was strongly committed to its alliance with pakistan following musharraf 's resignation . he praised musharraf 's economic and security achievements , described pakistan as a `` vital friend '' and said britain 's aid program for the country would continue . meanwhile , an afghanistan government spokesman said musharraf 's resignation would be good for afghanistan . the indian government said in a statement that it had no comment to make . `` this is an internal matter of pakistan .

'' military officials said both marines were stationed at camp lejeune , which is about two hours away from wimunc 's fayetteville home . joe lenczyk -- resident agent-in-charge for the federal bureau of alcohol , tobacco , firearms and explosives -- said wimunc and her husband were estranged and lived apart . wimunc is the second female soldier from fort bragg to die under suspicious circumstances in recent weeks . spc. megan lynn touma , 23 , was seven months pregnant at the time of her death in june , authorities said . investigators say they are treating that death as a homicide . camp lejeune also has had a suspicious death of a female soldier this year . twenty-year-old pregnant marine lance cpl. maria lauterbach 's charred body was found january in the back yard of another marine stationed at the base . that suspect , u.s. marine cpl. cesar laurean , was captured in april in mexico .

'' moyo -- the national chairman of the main movement for democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- party -- received 110 votes while his only opponent , paul themba-nyathi , received 98 votes . the speaker of the parliament is the fourth most powerful post in zimbabwe . themba-nyathi represented the splinter mdc faction led by arthur mutambara , but he had support of president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf party . the vote took place hours after mugabe swore in lawmakers , five months after they were elected . two members of the main mdc -- led by presidential candidate morgan tsvangirai -- were arrested as they arrived at the opening session , but they were released after a short time , according to a government spokesman . an mdc official said the arrests were part of the `` sinister agenda of this regime '' to `` tilt the balance of numbers in their favour during the voting for the speaker of parliament . '' one of those detained -- shuwa mudiwa -- appeared back in parliament , but the other member -- elia jembere -- was not seen , according to sources . government spokesman bright matonga said jembere had been accused of rape , but that he has been released from custody . a third member -- elton mangoma -- escaped an arrest attempt when other party members came to his rescue , mdc officials said . attendance at the session of parliament is important since the membership is closely divided between the mdc and the mugabe 's zanu-pf . the ruling zanu-pf party lost its majority in the 210-seat parliament in elections in march , but vote recounts and political violence have delayed the body from convening until now . final results gave 100 seats to an mdc faction led by morgan tsvangirai , the party 's presidential candidate . president robert mugabe 's zanu-pf got 99 seats . an offshoot of the main mdc party , led by arthur mutambara , won 10 seats . an independent candidate won one seat . tsvangirai , who was locked in a bitter presidential contest with mugabe , had objected to mugabe 's decision to convene parliament , saying it could `` decapitate '' power-sharing talks that have been on hold for the past two weeks . still , tsvangirai said he would attend the swearing-in ceremony . mdc party spokesman nelson chamisa said all mdc members elected to parliament were expected to attend `` except those few mps who are still in hiding .

853	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- u.s. house speaker nancy pelosi reversed her opposition to a vote on offshore drilling on `` larry king live '' on monday night , saying she would consider a vote if it were part of a larger energy package . u.s. house speaker nancy pelosi urges the release of oil from strategic reserves as a way to bring down gas prices . pelosi and fellow house democrats have staunchly opposed republicans ' request for a vote on the drilling . some republicans stayed in chambers after congress adjourned for the session , making speeches on energy policies , in an attempt to get democrats to come back for a vote . reacting to pelosi 's remarks , house minority leader john boehner , r-ohio , said the speaker should call the house of representatives back from its summer recess immediately if she is sincere about a vote on off-shore drilling . `` our message to speaker pelosi is very simple : we are ready to vote on more energy production and lower gas prices right now , and we should not wait one more day to begin giving the american people the relief they expect and deserve , '' boehner said . `` if you meant what you said last night , we welcome you and your democratic colleagues to join us in our historic call to action on american energy . '' on monday night , pelosi said the vote would need to be part of a larger discussion that would include investing in renewable energy resources and releasing oil from the strategic petroleum reserve . those options would help bring both immediate and long-lasting solutions to the energy crisis , she said . in her interview with king , pelosi talked about what the government and country needs to do to avert the energy crisis and quickly bring down gas prices . the following is an edited version of the interview : . larry king : ok , madam speaker , author of `` know your power , '' why do n't you bring -lsb- congress -rsb- back ? speaker nancy pelosi : well , it 's interesting to hear sen. -lsb- john -rsb- mccain talk about bringing congress back . he was n't even in congress this last session when we really had two very important bills on energy -- one to give tax credit for wind , solar and other renewable resources , and another about hybrid cars and the rest . so he was n't in to vote when were in session and now he 's saying call it back in . and then one of the others said to the president , call congress back in . and the president said no . the president said no . but the point is this : the american people are suffering . we have to do what is best for them . how do we bring down the prices at the pump ? we have said to the president , the fastest way to do this if in 10 days the price can come down if you will free our oil . over 700 million barrels of oil the president is sitting on of the strategic petroleum reserve . no. 1 , free our oil . no. 2 , they want to drill . if they want to drill , we have 68 million acres in the lower 48 that they can drill in that are permitted and all the rest . three , stop the speculation . four , renew -- invest in renewable energy resources , which will bring a faster return than drilling offshore , which will take 10 years and produce 2 cents ' reduction in 10 years off the price at the pump . and then use natural gas . natural gas is so plentiful . it 's better for the environment , and it is cheaper . so there are things that congress can do , and we have voted on this over and over again . but the republicans and the president have resisted . instead , they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas . well , we can do that . we can have a vote on that . but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and not just a hoax on them . king : would you vote yes on a package that includes drilling ? pelosi : i would not . it depends how the drilling is put forth . but i do n't -- that is not excluded , let me say it that way . it depends how that is proposed , if the safeguards are there . now , mind you , 68 million acres -- 10 million more acres in alaska where they can drill . but if there 's -- if we can get some great things , in terms of renewable energy resources : a renewable electricity standard , wind , solar , biofuels and the rest in that context , because if you make a decision only to go with the offshore drilling , you are increasing our dependence on fossil fuels , and you will never free yourself of that addiction unless you invest in the renewable energy resources that are good for the environment , cheaper for the consumer and will reverse global warming . and the consumer is our first responsibility . the american taxpayer owns this oil offshore , by the way . let me make this one final point . this oil is owned by the american taxpayers . the oil companies drill . we give them money to drill there . but we get very little in return . so i think as we have this debate , which is a very healthy one to have and i welcome it ; we have to review and realign the relationship between our oil , big oil 's profits and what it means to the consumer and the taxpayer . king : do you expect -- do you suspect the oil companies of having a lot of clout here , influence over the republicans ? pelosi : of course . yes , they rule . and that 's what we 'll find out . king : they rule ? pelosi : when we have this vote , when we really define it and where the choice is clear to the american people -- i mean , do you know what -- exxon mobil , their last quarter , their profits were historic . last year , they were historic . they outdid themselves this year already in this second quarter . and they insist that we pay them to drill . they need an incentive to drill in order to make over $ 11 billion in one quarter . and it just does n't make sense . we should be using that money to invest in renewable resources , tax credit for wind and solar , etc. and invest in the technologies that will develop the battery and the rest , instead of giving big oil more profits . king : do you expect to get a big enough majority in the senate and house for the democrats to overcome anything and get through your proposals ? pelosi : well , i hope we can do some of it before we even leave this session . i think we can -- hopefully , we can do something before december . i will not subscribe to a hoax on the american people that if you drill offshore , you 're going to bring down the price at the pump . even the president says that 's not true . ten years , two cents -- we 're saying 10 days , bring down the price , if the president would free our oil from the strategic petroleum -lsb- reserve -rsb- -- from our stockpile -- owned by the taxpayers , purchased by the taxpayers . in the next election , i know that we will strengthen our majorities , increase their numbers , and we will have a democratic president in the white house , and we will be able to address more fully really what i think is the challenge to our generation -- energy security and global warming .
854	mogadishu , somalia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a roadside bombing in somalia 's capital killed 21 women who were cleaning rubbish from a southern mogadishu street on sunday morning , a hospital official said . mogadishu residents gather around victims of the bomb attack along the city 's maka al mukarama road . the bomb blast wounded another 46 people , most of them somali women who had gathered to clean maka al mukarama road in southern mogadishu 's kilometer 4 district , according to medina hospital director dr. dahir dhere . `` it suddenly turned the area into a carnage , scattering body parts of the street cleaners into a large area , '' said witness asha ise gedi . `` there were pools of blood everywhere . i have never seen such mass killing . '' `` they were innocent poor mothers or sisters , '' gedi said . `` why did they deserve this ? '' it is unclear who is behind the attack . mogadishu mayor mohamed omar habeb mohamed dhere , who was recently fired by the country 's prime minister , blamed the islamic courts union for waging the attack . but the head of the islamist insurgent group , abid rahim ise adow , denied any involvement and blamed somalia 's government for orchestrating the attack . the victims were participating in a program that allows somali women to work as street cleaners in exchange for food . the united nations ' world food program organized the program , which began last year and is administered by mogadishu 's regional authority . mogadishu has been the site of violence in recent months between ethiopian troops and islamist fighters . somalia 's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital , with the help of the better-equipped ethiopian forces . on saturday , two-thirds of the somali government ministers announced their resignations , blaming prime minister nur hassan nur ade 's `` dictatorship , '' which they said included his firing of mogadishu 's mayor . nur ade said he suspects the mass resignations were aimed at weakening implementation of the peace agreement between somalia 's transitional government and the opposition alliance for the re-liberation of somalia . he said he had no plans to resign . the peace agreement , signed june 9 in djibouti , calls for a cease-fire between somalia 's u.n.-backed transitional government and the alliance for the re-liberation of somalia , an opposition group that includes members of the islamist court union which overthrew the government in 2006 . the icu was ousted from power later that year by ethiopian forces , with the support of somalia 's transitional government . if followed , the peace deal would pave the way for a withdrawal of ethiopian troops -- a major sticking point for islamist fighters who oppose their presence . the agreement calls on the alliance to dissociate itself from armed groups still fighting the government and for all sides to allow `` unhindered humanitarian access and assistance '' to all somalis . a joint committee led by u.n. officials will monitor the agreement 's implementation . ethiopian forces became embroiled in an islamist insurgency after the ethiopian forces invaded somalia in december 2006 to overthrow the icu leaders and reinstall the transitional government . as guerrilla attacks mounted , efforts to replace the ethiopians with an african union-led peacekeeping mission faltered . ethiopia 's invasion had the blessing of somalia 's government and the united states , which accused the icu of harboring fugitives from the al qaeda terrorist movement . the conflict displaced hundreds of thousands of somalis , further worsening a humanitarian crisis that dates back to the collapse of the country 's last government in 1991 . the situation has been exacerbated by drought , continual armed conflicts in central and southern somalia , and high inflation on food and fuel prices . cnn 's alan duke and journalists mohamed amin adow and abdi nasir mohamed contributed to this report .

'' at least 51 people were killed in southwestern haiti and eight were killed in neighboring dominican republic as gustav roared through as a category 1 hurricane on wednesday , officials there said . the hurricane center 's five-day forecast places a landfall anywhere from galveston , texas , east to mobile , alabama . new orleans , louisiana , is at the center of the projected path . a hurricane watch remained in effect for the northern gulf coast from east of high island , texas , to the alabama-florida border , including the city of new orleans and lake pontchartrain , the national hurricane center said . a watch means hurricane conditions are possible within the specified area , generally within 36 hours . the gulf coast is still recovering from hurricane katrina , which killed more than 1,800 people when it slammed ashore august 29 , 2005 . mississippi gov. haley barbour said hurricane katrina victims living in government-issued trailers or mobile homes along his state 's coast will begin evacuating this weekend . gustav is the second major hurricane of the 2008 atlantic hurricane season . meanwhile , tropical storm hanna passed north of the leeward islands on friday with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph -lrb- 80 kph -rrb- , the hurricane center said . the center predicted gradual strengthening , and hanna could be near hurricane strength sunday . copyright 2008 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .

858	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. charles schumer said sunday the bush administration is trying to `` blame the fire on the person who calls 911 '' by suggesting he had a role in one of the costliest u.s. bank failures . sen. charles schumer said the ots `` ought to stop pointing false fingers of blame . '' federal regulators with the office of thrift supervision were `` asleep at the switch '' when it came to indymac 's `` reckless '' behavior , the new york democrat complained . the ots announced friday that it was taking over the $ 32 billion indymac and transferring control to the federal deposit insurance corporation . the ots pointed the finger directly at schumer for the failure , accusing him of sparking a bank run by releasing a letter that `` expressed concerns about indymac 's viability . '' watch what 's next for indymac '' `` in the following 11 business days , depositors withdrew more than $ 1.3 billion from their accounts , '' the ots said in a statement announcing the california-based lender 's takeover on friday . the statement included a quote from ots director john reich saying , `` although this institution was already in distress , i am troubled by any interference in the regulatory process . '' schumer , a member of the senate banking committee , chairman of congress ' joint economic committee and the third-ranking democrat in the senate , rejected any suggestions of responsibility for indymac 's collapse . `` ots ought to stop pointing false fingers of blame and start doing its job to protect the future of the banking system , so that there wo n't be other indymacs , '' he said . schumer 's june 26 letter said he was `` concerned that indymac 's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers . '' in a sunday news conference , he said everything in his letter was already known to the public . `` indymac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks , '' he said . `` it was a spinoff from the old countrywide , and like countrywide , it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have . both indymac and countrywide helped cause the housing crisis we 're now in . '' the embattled countrywide financial corp. was recently purchased by bank of america . schumer argued that the `` breadth and depth '' of the problems at indymac were `` apparent for years , and they accelerated in the last six months . '' but ots , he said , `` was asleep at the switch and allowed things to happen without restraint . `` and now they are doing what the bush administration always does : blame the fire on the person who calls 911 . '' the white house had no immediate response . schumer said ots is `` known as a weak regulator , '' and added , `` my job was to try and toughen them up and that 's what i tried to do .

861	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- federal investigators will declare the 2001 anthrax case solved on wednesday , when they make public their case against government researcher bruce ivins , a government source familiar with the case told cnn on tuesday . ex-army scientist bruce ivins , seen here in 2003 , died from an apparent suicide last week . but the case will not be considered closed , because administrative details remain incomplete , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing . before making the information public , the fbi is expected to share the evidence of ivins ' involvement with survivors and relatives of victims in the anthrax attacks , the source said . a lawyer for maureen stevens , the widow of bob stevens , the first victim of the 2001 attacks , said she was invited to the session and will attend . the tabloid photo editor died after inhaling anthrax that investigators believe was in a letter sent to american media inc. , the publisher of the sun and national enquirer tabloids , at its offices in boca raton , florida . another source familiar with the investigation said tuesday that in the fall of 2001 , ivins borrowed a machine that can convert wet anthrax , the kind used at fort detrick , into dry powder , which was found in the anthrax letters . such machines , called lyophilizers , are not usually used at fort detrick , where ivins worked , though they are easy to obtain . experts said the report may have no significance . `` i would n't necessarily make the conclusion that , just because he had access to a lyophilizer and used a lyophilizer , that that provides a smoking gun , that he must be using this for sinister purposes , '' said peter hotez , chairman of microbiology at george washington university in washington . richard spertzel , a former biodefense scientist who worked with ivins at the lab at fort detrick , said there was `` no way '' a lyophilizer could have created the fine anthrax spores used in the 2001 letters . spertzel said a more advanced machine would have been needed , and that no one working at a u.s. government lab could have produced such high quality anthrax in secret . ivins , who is expected to be blamed for the mailings of the toxin , which killed five people and sickened more than a dozen others -- died july 27 at a hospital in frederick , maryland , from an apparent suicide attempt two days earlier . no charges have been made public . he became a suspect after investigators found dna evidence from the 2001 anthrax mailings on a flask used in his laboratory at the u.s. army medical institute of infectious diseases , said a source who is familiar with the investigation but not authorized to speak publicly about the case . ivins had worked for decades in the biodefense lab at fort detrick , where he was trying to develop a better vaccine against the toxin . the fbi had traced the anthrax used in the attacks to the lab by using a new technology , a u.s. official familiar with the investigation said . authorities were looking at whether ivins may have released anthrax to test a vaccine he was working on , another official said . some of the anthrax-laced letters , written in crude block letters , included the words , `` take penacilin -lrb- sic -rrb- now , '' according to photographs released by the fbi . since ivins ' death , suspicions about his involvement in the anthrax attacks have surfaced alongside questions about his sanity . at the time of his death , the 62-year-old scientist was under a temporary restraining order sought by a social worker who had counseled him in private and group sessions . she accused him of having harassed , stalked and threatened her with violence . the woman told the court in her complaint that ivins had been treated at a mental health facility . steven hatfill , another government scientist who was named by the justice department as a `` person of interest '' in the attacks , was never charged . he sued the department , which settled the case in june . the skepticism in scientific circles about the strength of the case against ivins heightens the importance of the government 's unveiling of its evidence against the scientist , a former prosecutor said . `` i think the public and the survivors of the anthrax attacks are entitled to see the evidence before the grand jury , '' said andrew mcbride . `` and if there was a draft indictment and they were ready to indict mr. ivins , they ought to see that as well .

'' klein 's group has reunited 1,500 families since it began work in 1990 . she said the former soviet union released records in 1989 of concentration camps it liberated , greatly helping organizers find information on holocaust victims . the organization has 100 volunteers -- a third of them holocaust survivors , klein said . the group also helps families find information about their loved ones who died during the holocaust . they have brought together more than 50 families this year . all of their work is free . she says it 's often like `` looking for a needle in a haystack . '' `` we 're playing beat the clock right now , '' she said , adding , `` it 's about families that one day they were together and then they were apart . '' `` when a connection is made , there are just smiles all around . '' that was the case for this family in ukraine . years of trauma , of separation , of not knowing what happened to loved ones , have been replaced by celebration . in a picturesque orchard overlooking rolling fields , galezkij , his wife and their neighbors laid out a feast for his american sister . as the vodka flowed , he told her how he had survived for a lifetime without her . `` he says he always thought he 'd see me someday . he dreamt lots about me , '' famulak said , as she sat next to her brother . `` and he wrote a song for me . when he went to sleep , he sang every night and cried .

'' smith is one of the people to whom recipients of the memo were told to direct journalists ' questions . in a written statement , the epa 's office of inspector general said it did not approve the language of robbi 's warning and advised , `` all epa officials and employees are required to cooperate '' with the office . `` this cooperation includes providing the oig full and unrestricted access to epa documents , records , and personnel , '' the statement read . `` we are currently engaged in discussions with oeca -lsb- office of enforcement and compliance assurance -rsb- to assure that oig and oeca interpretations are consistent in this matter . '' and sen. barbara boxer , a california democrat who has long battled with the agency 's administrator , stephen johnson , said the instructions showed that johnson is `` turning the epa into a secretive , dangerous ally of polluters , instead of a leader in the effort to protect the health and safety of the american people . '' last week , johnson denied a request to appear before two senate committees to talk about whether the epa 's decisions comply with its staff 's legal and technical recommendations . the committee 's chairman , sen. patrick leahy , d-vermont , has asked the inspector general 's office to assess the administration 's claims of executive privilege as it tries to keep documents related to epa decisions from congress . boxer chairs the senate committee on the environment and public works . she is expected to hold a news conference tuesday to talk about what she calls `` political interference in recent epa decisions '' and discuss `` apparent contradictions between the sworn testimony '' of johnson and accounts given by other sworn witnesses .

872	buenos aires , argentina -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president cristina fernandez de kirchner repeated her call this week to decriminalize personal drug use and crack down on traffickers and dealers . president cristina fernandez de kirchner says she does n't like to `` condemn someone who has an addiction . '' `` i do n't like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal , as if he were a person who should be persecuted , '' she told a meeting of the national investigation into the consumption of alcohol , tobacco , psychopharmaceuticals and illegal drugs . `` those who should be persecuted are those who sell the substances , those who give it away , those who traffic in it . '' a poll shows 2 percent of argentines have tried cocaine , but some people believe decriminalization of drugs could result in wider drug use . regardless , the argentine government is pushing congress to pass the decriminalization legislation by the end of the year . `` decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second-generation human rights , but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention , so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance , '' said anibal fernandez , the minister of security and justice . ethan nadelmann , founder and executive director of the new york-based drug policy alliance , said such policies have been adopted throughout europe and other parts of latin america . `` the evidence generally shows that the decriminalization of possession is not clearly associated with any increase in illicit drug use , '' he said . a few years ago , then-mexican president vicente fox proposed decriminalizing possession of drugs combined with a crackdown on traffickers , but a harsh reaction from the bush administration caused him to retreat , nadelmann said . brazil and colombia have passed laws decriminalizing drug use in an effort to combat the spread of hiv among injecting drug users , he said . politicians recognize that `` you basically need to get those people out of the underground and into health systems , '' nadelmann said . `` this would be part of a growing number of countries in latin america where there is , either for political or judicial reasons , a push toward decriminalization of personal possession , sometimes combined with initiatives to crack down harder on bigger drug traffickers , '' he said . `` it typically involves both lessening the criminal sanction for possession of cannabis while also providing for alternatives to incarceration for people addicted to drugs who are arrested for drug possession or other minor offenses . '' the concept has gained followers in the united states , too , he said , citing statistics that show two-thirds of americans support drug treatment instead of jail time for first-time drug offenders . on wednesday , rep. barney frank announced a proposal to end federal penalties for americans carrying fewer than 100 grams , or almost a quarter-pound , of marijuana . `` the vast amount of human activity ought to be none of the government 's business , '' frank said on capitol hill . `` i do n't think it is the government 's business to tell you how to spend your leisure time .

888	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the dramatic drop in violence in iraq is due in large part to a secret program the u.s. military has used to kill terrorists , according to a new book by pulitzer prize-winning journalist bob woodward . bob woodward 's book , `` the war within : secret white house history 2006-2008 , '' came out monday . the program -- which woodward compares to the world war ii era manhattan project that developed the atomic bomb -- must remain secret for now or it would `` get people killed , '' woodward said monday on cnn 's larry king live . `` it is a wonderful example of american ingenuity solving a problem in war , as we often have , '' woodward said . in `` the war within : secret white house history 2006-2008 , '' woodward disclosed the existence of secret operational capabilities developed by the military to locate , target and kill leaders of al qaeda in iraq and other insurgent leaders . national security adviser stephen hadley , in a written statement reacting to woodward 's book , acknowledged the new strategy . yet he disputed woodward 's conclusion that the `` surge '' of 30,000 u.s. troops into iraq was not the primary reason for the decline in violent attacks . `` it was the surge that provided more resources and a security context to support newly developed techniques and operations , '' hadley wrote . woodward , associate editor of the washington post , wrote that along with the surge and the new covert tactics , two other factors helped reduce the violence . watch bob woodward explain the strategy '' one was the decision of militant cleric muqtada al-sadr to order a cease-fire by his mehdi army . the other was the `` anbar awakening '' movement that saw sunni tribes aligning with u.s. troops to battle al qaeda in iraq . woodward told larry king that while there is a debate over how much credit the new secret operations should get for the drop in violence , he concluded it `` accounts for a good portion . '' `` i would somewhat compare it to the manhattan project in world war ii , '' he said `` it 's a ski slope right down in a matter of months , cutting the violence in half . this is n't going to happen with the bunch of joint security stations or the surge . '' the top secret operations , he said , will `` some day in history ... be described to people 's amazement . '' while he would not reveal the details , woodward said the terrorists who have been targeted were already aware of the capabilities . `` the enemy has a heads up because they 've been getting wiped out and a lot of them have been killed , '' he said . `` it 's not news to them . `` if you were a member of al qaeda or the resistance or some extremist militia , you would be wise to get your rear end out of town , '' woodward said . `` it is very dangerous .

889	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- journalist bob woodward describes in his new book a secret u.s. program to assassinate terrorists in iraq . cnn 's michael ware says , `` the u.s. subcontracted out an assassination program against al qaeda ... in early 2006 . '' woodward , an associate editor of the washington post , says in `` the war within : a secret white house history 2006-2008 '' that the assassination program , not the 2007 increase in u.s. forces in the war zone known as `` the surge , '' is primarily responsible for the reduction of violence in iraq . cnn baghdad correspondent michael ware cast doubt on woodward 's assertion tuesday in a conversation with `` american morning '' host john roberts . watch larry king on his talk with woodward '' john roberts : what do you think of what woodward is saying ? michael ware : let 's say that these `` fusion teams , '' as they 're being called , have come into effect . the first thing to say is , `` well , about time . '' on the ground you 've seen the lack of coordination as the left hand of one agency is not with the right hand of another agency within the american effort . but by and large , to suggest that anything like this being done now has been the major reason for the decline in violence is a bit rich . i mean , the u.s. subcontracted out an assassination program against al qaeda way back in early 2006 . and this was conceded by the then-chief of military intelligence in baghdad and by -lsb- u.s. -rsb- ambassador zalmay khalilzad himself . that 's what broke the back of al qaeda . then when america put 100,000-plus insurgents on the u.s. government payroll , including members of al qaeda , that not only took them out of the field , but it also let them run their own assassination programs against the iranian-backed militias . roberts : so it sounds like assassination was a real part of the program here , but was that the only thing that worked ? what about the addition of these troops and these neighborhood stations that were set up ? did it all kind of work together ? ware : it does work together . but the key to the downturn in violence that we 're seeing now is not so much the surge of 30,000 troops in itself . what it 's been is the segregation of baghdad into these enclaves . it 's been cutting a deal with muqtada al-sadr , the leader of the iranian-backed militia . and primarily it 's been putting your enemy on your payroll -- the sunni insurgents and many members of al qaeda . that 's what 's brought down the violence . this is your american militia , the counterbalance to the iranian militias . so if there 's new teams out there with new technology , great . but they 're riding the wave of previous success .
890	-lrb- cnn traveller -rrb- -- when the roman emperor hadrian came to power in 117ad he inherited an empire that was overstretched militarily and creaking at the seams . a massive bust of hadrian 's head unearthed only last year is part of the exhibition at the british museum . one of his first acts was to pull the troops out of mesopotamia , modern-day iraq , a fact that is sure to resonate with visitors to the british museum `` s superb exhibition `` hadrian : empire and conflict '' which opens on 24 july under the imposing classical dome of the reading room . curator torsten opper says : `` no matter what our take is on the conflict in iraq today , we can relate to hadrian 's decision . maybe 10 or 15 years ago , it would n't have mattered so much . now it does . '' hadrian was born in rome to a noble family whose origins lay in spain . one of the greatest of rome 's emperors , he consolidated imperial power , was a patron of architecture and travelled extensively across his lands . though married , he also took a homosexual lover , antinous , whose drowning in the river nile on the very day egyptians were celebrating the death in a similar manner of the god osiris remains one of ancient history 's great unsolved mysteries . the range of exhibits and their rarity means that this exhibition is going to be extremely well-attended . visitors will , for example , be the first members of the public anywhere to see a huge head of the emperor that was dug up recently at sagalassos in central turkey and would have once crowned a statue that was over five metres high . `` a year ago , this was still lying buried in the ground , '' says opper . `` it `` s proof that roman history is n't done and dusted ; that we are still able to rethink the past and evaluate it . '' the exhibition brings together 180 objects , from 31 sources in 11 different countries . `` it has n't been an easy thing to do , '' adds opper . `` many of these objects leave huge gaps in their home collection and many are extremely delicate . this is n't an exhibition that can travel . people will only be able to view it for these three months . '' many of the most delicate objects are also those that give the most dramatic insight into hadrian 's reign . between 132ad and 135/6ad the jews of judea rebelled against roman rule . some of the insurgents took refuge in a cave in the desert , called the cave of letters , in which they were trapped by roman troops . few made it out alive . the climatic conditions of the cave have preserved objects in astonishing condition . there is a letter written by jewish leader simon bar kokhba -lrb- enquiring about a delivery of supplies -rrb- , as well as mirrors , a jewellery box and an astonishingly delicate glass plate , probably made in alexandria , that somehow survived flight into the desert and the perilous climb up a cliff to the cave . then there are three house keys , their wooden handles preserved , looking as if they would still open the locks for which they were made . opper says : `` they `` re immediately touching -- these were used by people to lock their homes thinking they `` d be back in a week or two , but of course they were n't -- they all perished . and there are still many refugees now who still have keys to the homes they once lived in . it `` s a potent symbol of conflict . '' to the british hadrian will always be associated with the wall that was built across northern england , an 117km rampart with a fortification every 1.6 km . in schoolroom history this has traditionally been seen as a defence against the barbarian tribes to the north , but it was n't necessarily so . `` the wall was a ruthlessly efficient symbol of oppression and in the end it broke the back of the local tribes , '' says opper . confirmation of this , perhaps , comes from two small writing tablets from the fortress of vindolanda , the oldest surviving hand-written documents in the british isles . in one an officer , presumably writing to a colleague who is taking over his post , derides the locals as the `` little british , '' not worthy of worrying about very much - brief , battered and faded the letter may be , but as an example of high-handed imperialism it is hard to beat . click here to subscribe to cnn traveller . copyright © 2008 ink publishing and cable news network , lp , lllp , a time warner company . all rights reserved .
891	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- canada announced wednesday that it will dispatch a warship to somalia 's coast to protect u.n. aid ships from pirate attacks . the canadian frigate hmcs ville de quebec will escort ships carrying food aid to somalia . `` canada is stepping up to the plate by tasking ville de quebec with the role of escorting world food programme ships to ensure their safe arrival at designated ports , '' canadian defense minister peter mackay said in a government news release . the united nations hunger program praised canada for answering its call for help , and said it hoped other governments would step forward to take over from canada once it completes its mission in a few weeks . the hmcs ville de quebec is a 440-foot frigate armed with torpedoes , surface-to-air missiles and other weapons , and carries a twin-engine sea king anti-submarine helicopter . ville de quebec , which can travel at speeds greater than 27 knots , will be dispatched after somalia 's transitional government formally authorizes the mission , the government 's news release said . wfp asked the world 's naval powers in mid-june to help its ships reach the more than 2 million people in need of aid . it put out the request weeks before french , danish and dutch warships ended their escort missions , which began in november . pirate attacks on unescorted ships have been a growing problem in somalia . three european freighters were hijacked off the horn of africa in june , adding to the 27 other reported attacks this year , according to the international maritime bureau , which tracks piracy . wfp delivers 80 percent of its aid to somalia by sea , and wfp spokesman peter smerdon said that if there are no warships to escort the food supply , the program will have to rely on ground or air travel to deliver the food . but both are dangerous and expensive . the agency said that if there is no assistance from naval powers , piracy will increase , and so will death and malnutrition . smerdon said that although somalia 's food crisis has n't yet reached the devastation of the early 1990s , `` we 're worried it will be .

895	los angeles , california -lrb- ap -rrb- -- the shoe phone on tv 's `` get smart '' was n't just a sneaky spy gadget , it was a technological marvel : a wireless , portable telephone that could be used anywhere -- though it did require a dime to make a call . today , almost everyone has a pocket-sized version that also takes photos , shoots video , sends e-mail and surfs the internet . about the only thing it does n't do is protect your feet . `` get smart '' comes to the big screen next week , along with a spate of new spy gadgets to help maxwell smart , agent 99 and the other spies at control . the gadgets are just as goofy as they were in the original tv series , but because technology has caught up with the writers ' imaginations , there 's a big difference : many of the movie 's doo-dads actually exist . `` our favorite thing is to take something that does sort of exist and just exaggerate it a little bit , '' said matt ember , who co-wrote the script . the film shows a tiny ipod alongside spy-worthy stuff such as a two-way tooth radio and a digital `` spy fly '' -- all of which are available now . `` it 's pushed to a level of success that perhaps it has n't achieved in the real world , but it 's real , it 's out there , so that 's fun '' added co-writer tom j. astle , a self-described science nut . director peter segal said he originally could n't believe such devices were real . `` i said , ` that 's too silly . i do n't think people will buy it , '' ' he recalled telling the writers . `` then they googled it and it came up as an actual thing . '' astle and ember saw the tooth radio in a magazine and thought it was a perfect fit for the film . `` that 's an example of taking inspiration from the old series in spirit , '' astle said . `` the inherent comedy of having a microphone in your mouth -- it 's really close to your voice and it 's easy to yell and be too loud . '' the inextricable link between gadgets and spy movies began with james bond in 1962 , said tv historian tim brooks , author of `` the complete directory to prime time network and cable tv shows . '' the often-preposterous devices bond used added levity to a genre that `` had always been deadly serious '' during the early years of the cold war , brooks said . back in the day , `` get smart '' ratcheted up the goofiness level with bulletproof pajamas , a bunsen-burner phone and other wacky gadgets that often did n't work . when the show debuted in 1965 , the nation was future-focused and obsessed with the promise of technology . the show played on that obsession , brooks said , introducing dozens of covert gadgets and props designed to make life easier for cold war-era secret agents . a cigarette lighter doubled as a .22 - caliber gun . a lipstick could record conversations or release poisonous gas . then there was the famous shoe phone and the always-dysfunctional `` cone of silence '' that could -lrb- theoretically -rrb- keep conversations private , even in a crowded room . `` it 's nothing that you would expect to find or would even make sense in real life , and that 's the gag , '' brooks said . `` it was part of what the show was about . you 'd watch wondering what 's next , where 's the phone going to be next time . ... it was like a satire of our fixation with gadgets . '' the movie also takes liberties with some familiar devices , such as portable lasers , retinal scanners and a tricked-out swiss army knife equipped with a flame-thrower and a mini crossbow . despite living in a high-tech world , movie fans still love spy gadgets , the filmmakers said : just look at the success of the bond franchise , which will soon introduce its 22nd installment , and spy spoofs such as `` austin powers . '' part of it is the undercover element , part of it is a cultural love for technology , and part of it is wishful thinking . `` human beings are tool-users , '' astle said . `` we would like to believe that our government -- the good guys -- have within their power tools and electronic gadgets that will protect us that are beyond what we could do . '' `` there is some reality to it , '' ember said . `` we do have facial-recognition software , but on the other hand , i 'm not allowed to bring shampoo on an airplane . ''

'' georgia , formerly part of the soviet union , is now looking west and has ambitions of joining nato . south ossetia has longed for and sometimes fought for independence since the 1920s when the soviet government made it an autonomous region within georgia . after the collapse of the soviet union , georgia broke away from moscow in 1991 and south ossetia voted overwhelmingly for its own independence . violence has been mounting in the region in recent days , with sporadic clashes between georgian forces and south ossetian separatists . georgian troops launched new attacks in south ossetia late thursday after a top government official said a unilateral cease-fire offer was met with separatist artillery fire . an emergency session of the u.n. security council on friday discussed the dramatic escalation of violence . the session ended friday morning without a statement about the fighting . copyright 2008 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .

900	miami , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the storm called hanna weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm tuesday morning as maximum sustained winds eased down to 70 mph , the national hurricane center said . this satellite image from monday shows hanna over the southern bahamas and the turks and caicos islands . despite the downgrade , hanna dropped torrential rain on the eastern bahamas , the turks and caicos islands , and haiti . hurricane warnings remained in effect . hanna 's path and strength remain uncertain , but the latest forecast map from the national hurricane center predicts it still could make landfall as a major hurricane on the southeastern u.s. coast by friday evening . hanna 's path early tuesday appeared to be a `` meandering '' loop across turks and caicos , but atmospheric changes over the western atlantic are expected to steer the storm northwestward over the next two or three days , according to forecasters . as of 5 a.m. et , hanna was a category 1 storm on the saffir-simpson hurricane scale with sustained winds of 80 mph -lrb- 129 kph -rrb- and gusts of up to 100 mph . ireport.com : watch hanna lash turks and caicos islands . three hours later , it was downgraded to a tropical storm as winds fell below the 74 mph threshold for hurricane status . it could return to hurricane status later tuesday or on wednesday , forecasters said . hanna 's line of fire could include the u.s. atlantic coast from miami , florida , to massachusetts , according to the hurricane center 's long-range forecast map . charleston , south carolina , appears in the middle of this `` cone of uncertainty , '' with hanna potentially making landfall there friday . `` it appears that the center has been meandering , '' forecasters said . the history of hurricanes that have been where hanna is now might argue against its heading toward the southeastern united states . none of the september storms that passed within 200 miles of hanna 's current location has gone there , with most heading into the gulf of mexico and others going to new england or nova scotia . still , forecasters said , `` the model guidance is remarkably well clustered '' in support of its forecast path for hanna . meanwhile , forecasters were keeping an eye on tropical storm ike , which was gaining strength in the mid-atlantic and appeared headed for the bahamas later in the week . it had maximum sustained winds of 50 mph tuesday morning .
901	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- officials in some gulf coast states spent the third anniversary of hurricane katrina on friday gearing up for what could be the biggest threat to the region since katrina hit in 2005 . new orleans mayor ray nagin attends a ceremony friday honoring hurricane katrina victims . hurricane gustav is poised to pass near or over the cayman islands on friday night and over western portions of cuba on saturday . it may approach the u.s. gulf coast by tuesday morning as a category 2 or 3 hurricane , the national hurricane center said friday . `` today , on that third anniversary , we 've got to be thinking about the future , '' mississippi gov. haley barbour said . `` as we pray for the best , we 're going to prepare for the worst , '' barbour announced friday that hurricane katrina victims living in government-issued trailers or mobile homes along his state 's coast will begin evacuating this weekend to prepare for the gustav 's possible arrival . the process will begin saturday , with notices going out to people living in federal emergency management agency trailers or mobile homes , as well as people living in more permanent structures known as `` mississippi cottages , '' he said . watch the gulf coast states prepare for gustav '' the evacuation will begin in harrison and hancock counties on sunday morning , barbour said . evacuation in jackson county will begin monday . about 4,300 families live in fema trailers or mobile homes , and 2,800 live in mississippi cottages , the governor 's office said . he said he would urge people living in privately owned mobile homes to evacuate as well . president bush declared an emergency in louisiana on friday , freeing up federal aid and allowing fema to coordinate relief efforts . louisiana gov. bobby jindal has declared a state of emergency and urged residents to update their evacuation plans . he said residents in certain southern parishes could be asked to leave friday or saturday . in plaquemines parish , where hurricane katrina roared ashore as a category 3 storm days after its initial landfall in florida , parish president billy nungesser called for a mandatory evacuation beginning at noon saturday . residents of the community of grand isle in jefferson parish were urged to begin voluntary evacuations friday afternoon , and voluntary evacuations for jean lafitte , crown point , barataria and areas outside the levee protection system are recommended beginning at noon saturday , the parish said in a news release . st. bernard parish , which was beginning transport friday for those who would need assistance , said it expected to call a mandatory evacuation saturday afternoon . in new orleans , which has yet to fully recover from hurricane katrina , mayor ray nagin on thursday urged residents living in fema units to make evacuation plans in case city officials order them to leave . watch sean callebs report on if new orleans is prepared '' `` travel trailers are unsafe during heavy winds , '' he said . `` as we continue to monitor and prepare for the possibility of hurricane gustav , i want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so . '' as of early this week , there were 2,829 fema trailers in orleans parish , the mayor 's office said . the city has designated 17 sites for people without transportation to board buses that would take them out of the city in the event of a mandatory evacuation . the city also arranged with amtrak for more than 7,000 seats to evacuate the elderly by train , said jerry sneed of city homeland security and emergency preparedness . signs of mobilization were apparent at louis armstrong new orleans international airport , where nearly every departure gate had long lines of elderly people in wheelchairs . rental car counters normally attended by tourists were filled with relief workers from the red cross and the fire department of new york 's disaster assistance response team . the dart team consisted of retired new york firefighters , jovial men with graying hair and larger waistlines . many are volunteers assisting the red cross who were in new york during the september 11 attacks and wanted to give back . the 40-member dart team of heavy-equipment operators , truck drivers and registered nurses was headed to alexandria , louisiana , to set up an evacuation shelter . after the storm , the team will feed , shelter and re-supply people in the areas affected by gustav . `` whatever small way you 're able to help , it 's a great feeling , '' said kevin wallace , a 23-year fdny veteran who 's helped after six disasters . `` whatever they need us to do , we do . '' all 2,500 inmates in orleans parish would be bused out from state and local facilities , orleans parish criminal sheriff marlin gusman told the new orleans times-picayune . new orleans police chief warren riley said this week that hundreds of officers will be posted in the uptown , downtown , central city and west bank areas to ensure an adequate law enforcement presence in the event of an emergency . during katrina , many new orleans officers were accused of leaving their posts as widespread crime and looting permeated the city . sixty-seven officers were fired for it , riley said . in addition to the police department 's actions , at least 1,500 louisiana national guard members arrived in new orleans on friday . homeland security secretary michael chertoff said his concerns for new orleans are twofold . first , he was worried about areas of potential weakness in the levee system , which he said the army corps of engineers monitor closely , and second , rainfall . `` you can build levees that are 100 feet high ; it 's not going to keep the rain out of the city . a very , very intense period of rain could flood the city , because the pace of the rainfall could exceed the ability to pump out of the city , '' he said . the only thing to do was prepare , he said . `` we evacuate ; we protect the integrity of the levees ; we continue to strengthen the levees ; that 's part of a total system of really driving down the risk to the people of new orleans , '' he said . the louisiana national guard has requested 20 helicopters from eight states to replace its helicopter air assault battalion , which is now serving in iraq with its 20 uh-60 black hawks . the guard is asking for uh-60 helicopters for search and rescue , as well as ch-47s , chinooks , which could drop large sandbags if the levees are breached . a 40-person aviation headquarters unit also is being requested and probably will be provided by the arkansas national guard to handle air traffic control and communications for any air operations that might be needed . in texas , gov. rick perry pre-emptively declared an emergency in 61 texas counties . he said also the state had agreed to take into its shelters several thousand louisiana residents , should they evacuate . cnn 's john couwels , chris lawrence , barbara starr , eric marropodi and kim segal contributed to this report .
902	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- justice department officials blocked liberals and people with democratic party ties from a highly selective program that funneled young lawyers into government jobs , according to an internal investigation released tuesday . a bias against liberals existed in a justice program meant to hire young lawyers , an investigation found . esther slater mcdonald , a political appointee at the justice department , `` wrote disparaging statements about the candidates ' liberal and democratic party affiliations on the applications she reviewed and ... she voted to deselect candidates on that basis , '' said the report by inspector general glenn fine . mcdonald , who has left the department , refused to be interviewed for the investigation . the report , the first official investigation to document politicization of the justice department during the bush administration , is an offshoot of the larger investigation of justice department politics triggered by the furor over the firing of nine u.s. attorneys . it found two of three members of a screening committee considered political views and experience when choosing new lawyers for the justice department honors program and summer law intern program . the report found that mcdonald and michael elston , the chief of staff to deputy attorney general paul mcnulty , engaged in misconduct , an administrative violation . the third member of the screening committee , career lawyer dan fridman , was cleared of any involvement in the politicization of the process . elston was interviewed by the investigators , who asked him about the role of former justice department official monica goodling in politicizing the selection process . elston told investigators he could not recall goodling telling him to select lawyers who appeared to share attorney general alberto gonzales ' philosophy . goodling testified before a house panel last year that she had told elston he should identify such candidates . goodling directed elston to lead the selection committee in 2006 . she and elston have both left the justice department . she refused to be interviewed for the inspector general 's report . as a result of the controversy , the hiring process was changed in 2007 to insulate hiring decisions from political considerations . both justice department policy and federal law prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of political affiliations . the report did not find clear evidence that an earlier screening committee took political considerations into account . it says data from 2002 shows a disparity in the hiring of liberal and conservative candidates , but there were no complaints about the committee 's work from 2003 to 2006 , when goodling put elston in charge of the process . the report tuesday is the first of perhaps several to be issued as the broad-ranging investigation into the role partisan politics has played in the justice department during the bush administration . goodling is expected to be a central figure in later inspector general reports examining efforts to increase the influence of conservatives in the department . the justice department office of professional responsibility , a separate watchdog office that monitors prosecutorial conduct , joined in the inspector general 's investigation . cnn 's terry frieden contributed to this report .

909	join roland martin for his weekly sound-off segment on cnn.com live at 10:30 a.m. et wednesday . if you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you . roland martin says journalists do n't serve the public if they push rumors . -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- two recent stories are a prime example of how important it is for the media to confront the reality of rumors in the age of the internet . one week before comedian bernie mac passed away , text messages and e-mails were flying all over the country with reports that he had died . i was in new york , and friends and colleagues from chicago , illinois , to dallas , texas , and los angeles , california , were saying they knew for sure that the 50-year-old comedian was dead . the rumor mill was so hot that his publicist had to release a statement making it clear that he was not dead , which was subsequently published by the chicago sun-times . what makes this story important is that it was left to the publicist and the family to decide to quash the rumor with the truth , and it was our job in the media to go with the news because it was the latest information made available regarding his condition . then there is the `` rumor '' of an affair by former north carolina senator and two-time presidential candidate john edwards . the story was broken by the national enquirer after months of digging . ultimately , a source came forward and was likely paid for the information that blew the lid off of the story ; the tabloid 's editor said `` you can assume '' the enquirer paid for it . the story exposed edwards as a liar for contending for two years that such an affair never happened . there has been a lot of hand wringing about why a major media outlet was n't able to verify the story and run with it . the heated discussions even reached the point where charlotte observer editor rick thames told pbs ' `` newshour with jim lehrer '' that since mainstream media no longer has the news cycle to itself , `` when rumor arises , we 're going to need to address it . and , unfortunately , we may need to address it before we can determine whether it 's true or not because it 's having impact , as it was in this case . '' sorry , rick , i disagree . the most fundamental aspect of being a journalist is that we do n't traffic in rumor and innuendo . none of us serves the public if we are in the business of pushing unverified stories into print or on the airwaves just so we can keep up with a rumor that is out of control . running with such rumors has far-reaching implications . just check out this month 's vanity fair , where bryan burroughs has a great story on the collapse of bear stearns . the investment bank 's demise , some conclude , was all a result of baseless rumors suggesting the company had cash problems , even though it was sitting on $ 18 billion . the rumors kept going and going and when the story hit the airwaves , it spread like wildfire . in one week , bear stearns was no more , and former company executives are still trying to determine what killed the wall street behemoth . we should forget the nonsense about the competitive pressure to break the story . the rules are simple : either you have the facts or you do n't . if you do , you run with the story . if you do n't , you leave it alone . the national enquirer got the story because its reporters were able to confront edwards as he was leaving the beverly hills hotel room of the woman with whom he later admitted having an affair . then the paper got its hands on what it said was a photo of the 2004 democratic vice presidential nominee playing with a baby the enquirer said was the child of the mistress . with other major media outlets turning up the heat , edwards admitted the affair in an interview with abc 's bob woodruff . no media executive should be pulling his or her hair out , trying to figure out why they chose not to spread the rumor . if they had , and the facts did n't support the rumor , then we would all look like fools and that would have angered the public even more . we have an obligation to stick with the facts , and nothing else . and no matter what a blogger , web site or tabloid paper has decided to run with , the day we choose to alter our standards , our credibility and integrity will be shot . in the end , as former abc news anchor max robinson said in 1988 , that 's all we 've got . nothing is worth losing that , even getting the scoop on an affair involving a candidate whose political career is likely over . roland s. martin is an award-winning journalist and cnn contributor . he is the author of `` listening to the spirit within : 50 perspectives on faith .

914	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush condemned the escalated violence between russia and u.s.-backed georgia on sunday , while vice president dick cheney said aggression against georgia `` must not go unanswered . '' president bush chats with russian prime minister vladmir putin at the start of the olympic opening ceremonies . `` my administration has been engaged with both sides of this trying to get a ceasefire , '' bush told nbc 's bob costas in an interview in beijing , china , where the president has attended olympic events . bush was filmed speaking to russian prime minister vladimir putin during friday 's opening ceremonies and said sunday that he `` was firm with vladimir putin '' and that `` this violence is unacceptable . '' violence has continued to rage between russia and the western ally since thursday , when georgia launched an operation to crack down on separatists in south ossetia territory . russia said it wanted to protect its peacekeepers already in south ossetia following ceasefires in years past . but georgia called it a full-on invasion . and while russia has accused georgia of a genocidal plot to cleanse the region of ethnic ossetians loyal to russia , georgia accuses russia of executing a long-planned war with the aim of taking control of the region -- including a key pipeline that carries asian oil to black sea ports . `` i expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia , '' bush said of his talk with putin . `` we strongly condemn bombing outside of south ossetia . '' putin says he 's concerned about the flood of refugees arriving in russia from south ossetia . russian officials said more than 30,000 refugees have left south ossetia and crossed into russia over the past two days , interfax reported . `` the actions of the georgian authorities in south ossetia are a crime , of course , primarily a crime against their own people , '' putin said , according to russian news agency interfax . meanwhile , cheney talked to georgian president mikheil saakashvili on sunday , telling him that russia 's aggression against georgia `` must not go unanswered . '' cheney 's spokeswoman lea ann mcbride said the vice president spoke to saakashvili to express `` the united states ' solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity . '' georgia withdrew its forces sunday and offered a ceasefire , which russia refused . `` the vice president told president saakashvili that russian aggression must not go unanswered , and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states , as well as the broader international community , '' mcbride said . saakashvili has called on the united states and the world community to stop the `` intervention and invasion of my sovereign country . '' `` i think the u.s. is the most powerful country in the world , '' he told cnn . `` i think the u.s. has lots of leverage . and i think there are lots of diplomatic means that it could be done through . '' two senior officials have told cnn the united states sent envoy matt bryza to the region to help with mediation .
915	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the new york times has rejected an essay that sen. john mccain wrote defending his iraq war policy . sen. john mccain wrote an op-ed for the new york times , but the paper said it could not publish it as written . the piece was in response to an op-ed from sen. barack obama that was published in the paper last week . in an e-mail to the mccain campaign , opinion page editor david shipley said he could not accept the piece as written , but would be `` pleased , though , to look at another draft . '' `` let me suggest an approach , '' he wrote friday . `` the obama piece worked for me because it offered new information -lrb- it appeared before his speech -rrb- ; while senator obama discussed senator mccain , he also went into detail about his own plans . it would be terrific to have an article from senator mccain that mirrors senator obama 's piece . '' read mccain 's rejected piece . in a statement released monday , the new york times said it is `` standard procedure on our op-ed page , and that of other newspapers , to go back and forth with an author on his or her submission . '' `` we look forward to publishing senator mccain 's views in our paper just as we have in the past . we have published at least seven op-ed pieces by senator mccain since 1996 . the new york times endorsed senator mccain as the republican candidate in the presidential primaries . we take his views very seriously , '' the statement said . mccain 's rejected op-ed was a lengthy critique of obama 's positions on iraq policy , particularly his view of the surge . `` senator obama seems to have learned nothing from recent history , '' wrote mccain , criticizing obama 's call for an early withdrawal timeline . `` i find it ironic that he is emulating the worst mistake of the bush administration by waving the ` mission accomplished ' banner prematurely . '' watch why the piece was rejected '' obama 's july 14 essay had taken shots at mccain for not further encouraging the iraqi government to take control of the country . `` instead of seizing the moment and encouraging iraqis to step up , the bush administration and senator mccain are refusing to embrace this transition -- despite their previous commitments to respect the will of iraq 's sovereign government , '' obama wrote in his op-ed . `` they call any timetable for the removal of american troops ` surrender , ' even though we would be turning iraq over to a sovereign iraqi government . '' read obama 's essay . shipley , who was president bill clinton 's senior speechwriter from 1995 to 1997 , had advised the mccain campaign that `` the article would have to articulate , in concrete terms , how senator mccain defines victory in iraq . `` it would also have to lay out a clear plan for achieving victory -- with troops levels , timetables and measures for compelling the iraqis to cooperate . and it would need to describe the senator 's afghanistan strategy , spelling out how it meshes with his iraq plan . '' he added that he hoped the parties could `` find a way to bring this to a happy resolution . '' mccain spokesman tucker bounds said monday the arizona senator 's position will not change based on the `` demands of the new york times . '' `` john mccain believes that victory in iraq must be based on conditions on the ground , not arbitrary timetables , '' he said . `` unlike barack obama , that position will not change based on politics or the demands of the new york times . '' the newspaper endorsed mccain for the republican presidential nomination in january , shortly before the new york primary . in february , after it became clear mccain would be his party 's presumptive nominee , the paper published a thinly sourced report that mccain once had a close relationship with a female lobbyist . mccain said he was disappointed in the new york times piece . the paper said that it stood by its reporting and that `` the story speaks for itself . '' mccain 's campaign sent out fundraising appeals based on the article . the article `` is particularly disgusting -- an un-sourced hit-and-run smear campaign designed to distract from the issues at stake in this election , '' mccain 's campaign manager , rick davis , wrote in a e-mail to supporters . `` we need your help to counteract the liberal establishment and fight back against the new york times by making an immediate contribution today , '' the e-mail said in text that linked to an online contribution form on the mccain campaign 's web site .
916	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- there 's no question `` tropic thunder '' takes chances . ben stiller , left , and robert downey jr. are among the stars of `` tropic thunder , '' a hollywood satire . tom cruise almost unrecognizable as a foulmouthed , foul-mannered movie executive ? check . mockery of action heroes , method actors and gross-out comedians ? check . challenging stereotypes at every opportunity ? absolutely . but casting robert downey jr. as a black man ? well , that might be a bit much . or maybe not . in `` tropic thunder , '' a comedy about self-absorbed hollywood types making a `` platoon '' - style war movie , downey plays australian actor kirk lazarus , a multiple oscar-winning performer who gets so involved in his roles that he forgets to come out of them . he 's a man constantly looking for ways to transform himself for his art . so , cast as a black man in the war movie , lazarus decides to dye his skin surgically . downey -- no slouch as an actor himself -- has often been seen as one who immerses himself fully in his roles . that kind of dedication prevented the character from coming off as offensive , said ben stiller , who directed , co-wrote and stars in `` tropic thunder . '' `` i give all the credit to robert , '' stiller told cnn . `` i felt he really was so committed to that character , the guy that was playing that guy , that as an audience you bought his sincerity . very few people , i think , could pull that off . '' brandon jackson , who plays hip-hop star turned actor alpa chino -lrb- say it fast -rrb- , agreed . `` robert was black the whole time . my mom came on the set and she thought it was don cheadle , '' he told cnn . `` i 'm serious . that 's how black he was . '' watch jackson talk about working with downey '' the movie , which also stars stiller as struggling action star tugg speedman and jack black as gross-out king jeff portnoy , features some testy altercations between downey 's lazarus and jackson 's chino . lazarus gets so involved in his role that even when it 's clear filming has wrapped for the day , he sticks with it -- which irritates chino to no end . `` to me the most important thing was alpa chino has to give him a beat down and tell him that what he 's doing is crazy the whole time , '' downey said . `` otherwise it 's just demeaning to brandon 's character . and if it 's demeaning to an actual black man in the movie ... i would have run for the hills . '' jackson said he would have challenged the movie if the material was offensive . but , he said , `` tropic thunder '' is a long way from the days when white performers would don blackface as a way of exploiting black stereotypes . since then , he said , the playing field has leveled : the wayans brothers played `` white chicks '' in the film of the same name , and eddie murphy has played several ethnicities in his films , including jewish and chinese characters . `` if we 're all gon na play ball , let 's all play ball , '' jackson said . `` i believe in fairness . if we can punch you , punch back . and funny is funny . '' ireport.com : will you see ` tropic thunder ' ? stiller , of course , is no stranger to testing comedy limits . the actor , writer and director , known for films such as `` meet the parents '' and `` zoolander , '' has performed or created roles that strike a delicate balance between sympathetic and distasteful -- and sometimes fall too hard on one side of the line . he co-wrote `` tropic thunder '' based on an idea he had in 1987 , when many of his friends were making war movies , he recalls in the film 's production notes . while stiller was making `` empire of the sun , '' his colleagues were in boot camps training for their military roles -- and would emerge talking about the boot camp as if they 'd become part of a real military unit . `` this sort of self-important , self-involved thing seemed funny to me , '' he said in the notes . `` i just could n't figure a way to make that into a movie . '' not immediately , anyway . but after several years , stiller and his colleagues worked out a story that not only mocked actors , but filmmaking in general . in `` thunder , '' after the studio threatens to shut down the big-budget production , the frustrated director -lrb- played by steve coogan -rrb- refuses to stop , and takes his cast deep into a southeast asia jungle to shoot `` guerrilla style . '' there they encounter danger in the form of drug lords . `` tropic thunder , '' which already has received praise from newsweek 's david ansen and the hollywood reporter 's kirk honeycutt , has also earned its share of knocks . the most serious have come from advocacy groups for the disabled , which are planning to picket monday 's los angeles premiere . in the film , speedman has made a bid for an oscar by playing `` simple jack , '' a developmentally disabled character . other characters in `` tropic thunder '' dismiss speedman 's attempt to play what they refer to as a `` retard . '' representatives of the special olympics , the arc of the united states , the national down syndrome congress , the american association of people with disabilities and other groups met with studio executives last week to discuss the film , but dreamworks did not make any changes . `` we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population , '' said peter wheeler , a spokesman for the special olympics , according to reuters . in a statement sunday , chip sullivan , a dreamworks spokesman , said the movie was `` an r-rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses and makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over-the-top characters in ridiculous situations . '' in the statement , sullivan added that the film was not meant to disparage or harm people with disabilities and that dreamworks expected to work closely with disability groups in the future . in junket interviews for the film , stiller said that screening audiences definitely found `` tropic thunder '' funny . `` you go out there and put your best foot forward in terms of what you think you 're doing , of what you think is the right idea , '' he said . `` if people are accepting it the way that you intended , and you feel that from a general audience ... then stand behind it . '' downey trusts that after years of making themselves known as actors who can skillfully walk that fine line between funny and offensive , audiences will accept the film 's satire -- his role in particular . `` i just hope at this point , with whatever little we 've done to brand ourselves as entertainers , that you give us a little slack , '' he said . cnn entertainment correspondent kareen wynter contributed to this report .
917	madrid , spain -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a spanair md-82 airliner was not on fire as it took off from madrid 's airport but lifted off slightly into the air , fell back to the ground and caught fire only after skidding off the side of the runway , a source familiar said friday . the plane crash victims ' bodies laid out at a makeshift morgue in madrid . a total of 153 people were killed . initially , there were indications that an engine might have caught fire as the plane was taking off , but the source said airport video shows the plane lifting off , veering sharply right and then dragging or skidding down the right side of the runway . there was a cloud of dust , the source said , followed by a fireball . canary islands regional president paulino rivero said after meeting with spain 's prime minister , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , that the latter had seen the video and described it as showing the plane using up all the runway as it tried to take off but then never reaching adequate altitude , the associated press reported . eighty of the bodies recovered from the wreckage of wednesday 's fiery plane crash have been identified , spanish authorities said friday . watch as spain deals with tragedy '' many of the bodies are so badly burned that fingerprint identification is impossible , and investigators will have to rely on dna , officials said . nineteen survivors remained hospitalized friday . the plane was all but destroyed in the crash , a rescue worker said . when emergency crews arrived on the scene , `` you could n't distinguish that there was an aircraft there , apart from the remains of the tail , '' ergivio corral said . `` if you did n't know it , you would n't have been able to say there was a plane .

918	like nearly everything else clinton-related this week , hillary clinton 's convention speech remained a question mark until the last minute . the overriding goal for hillary clinton on tuesday night was to redirect her supporters toward barack obama . its content was a mystery to even some of her closest advisers , who told cnn hours before the speech they were n't sure it was finished quite yet . it was a work in progress until the very end -- and one of its strongest rallying cries appeared nowhere in the prepared text . `` that is our mission , democrats -- let us elect barack obama and joe biden , '' the new york senator told a capacity crowd waving signs that said `` unity '' on one side and bore either clinton 's or obama 's name on the other . so far , the democratic convention has been dominated by news of the clintons . what would hillary clinton say tuesday night ? and what would her husband , former president bill clinton , say wednesday night ? would daughter chelsea introduce her mother onstage , fueling visions of another democratic dynasty ? and what will happen wednesday , when the convention roll call will either provide the `` catharsis '' clinton predicted it might -- or reopen primary season wounds ? watch clinton 's entire speech '' the overriding goal for clinton tuesday night was to redirect the energy and emotion of her strongest supporters to the presumptive nominee 's campaign -- if not for his political future , for her own . if the rank-and-file believe a schism in the party generated by her supporters cost democrats the election , it could sabotage any potential white house plans for her . she pushed for her loyalists to back her primary season rival with language that echoed her stump speech about forgotten americans : . `` i want you to ask yourselves : were you in this campaign just for me ? '' she asked . `` or were you in it for that young marine and others like him ? were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids ? were you in it for that boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage ? were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible ? '' read what analysts say about clinton 's speech . she gave obama the seal of approval on health care , an issue that made for some of her toughest language on the trail . `` i ca n't wait to watch barack obama sign a health care plan into law that covers every single american , '' she said . there were a few notable gaps . there was little on foreign policy . there was no unequivocal statement that barack obama is qualified to be commander in chief and ready to lead from day one . mccain advisers noted soon after the speech , there was no mention of the candidates ' differing stands on abortion -- one issue which might have been expected to resonate with those women who supported clinton and have been slow to warm to obama . but clinton 's language about what was at stake this november could have been lifted from a speech by any of the most passionate obama supporters . `` nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance , '' she told the crowd . `` i want you to think about your children and grandchildren come election day . and think about the choices your parents and grandparents made that had such a big impact on your life and on the life of our nation . '' clinton has not addressed whether another presidential campaign is possible anytime in her future , but some of her senior advisers have been less reticent . there 's no way to tell whether their predictions come from inside knowledge or wishful thinking , but senior clinton aides like former campaign chairman terry mcauliffe and former campaign communications director howard wolfson have told reporters this week that they expect her to make another run for the white house in eight years -- after a two-term obama presidency . if that happens , tuesday night may have marked the first speech of her 2016 campaign .
919	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- federal regulators announced $ 7.1 million in fines against american airlines on thursday over maintenance issues and problems with its drug - and alcohol-testing programs . american airlines was fined for allowing aircrafts to fly while they knew they needed repairs . `` the faa believes the large total amount of the fine for these violations is appropriate because american airlines was aware that appropriate repairs were needed , and instead deferred maintenance , '' the federal aviation administration said in a statement announcing the decision . `` in intentionally continuing to fly the aircraft , the carrier did not follow important safety regulations intended to protect passengers and crew . '' american can still appeal the fines , the faa said . the faa also found the airline maintained inadequate drug - and alcohol-testing programs and failed to inspect safety lighting on a `` timely '' basis . the fort worth , texas-based carrier said thursday evening that it disagreed with the findings and called the penalties `` excessive .

'' nearly $ 4.5 million of the proposed fines stem from american 's continued operation of two md-83 jetliners in december 2007 after pilots reported problems with the autopilot systems , the faa said . the two planes were flown a combined 58 times before the problems were corrected -- and one flew 10 times after an faa inspector notified the airline that it had wrongly deferred needed repairs . in one incident , the autopilot disconnected during a landing on december 21 , the faa said . `` american technicians did not check for the actual problem , and instead deferred maintenance using an inappropriate mel -lrb- minimum equipment list -rrb- item . the plane flew another 36 passenger-carrying flights during december 21-31 . '' the problem was later traced to a piece of radio gear separate from the autopilot , the faa said . meanwhile , a different md-83 flew four flights without a fully functioning autopilot after american mechanics put off repairs . regulators also accuse american of operating planes without timely inspections of their emergency lighting systems . in april , american canceled more than 3,000 flights to conduct inspections of wiring bundles in wheel wells of its 300 md-80 jets , snarling air traffic for five days . the faa ordered american and several other airlines to examine the wiring , which had the potential to start fires or cause landing gear to malfunction .

922	cern , switzerland -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- scientists wednesday applauded as one of the most ambitious experiments ever conceived got successfully underway , with protons being fired around a 27-kilometer -lrb- 17-mile -rrb- tunnel deep beneath the border of france and switzerland in an attempt to unlock the secrets of the universe . scientists applaud during the switch on operation of the large hadron collider . the large hadron collider -- a $ 9 billion particle accelerator designed to simulate conditions of the big bang that created the physical universe -- was switched on at 0732 gmt to cheers and applause from experts gathered to witness the event . while observers were left nonplussed by the anticlimactic flashing dots on a tv screen that signalled the machine 's successful test run , among teams of scientists involved around the world there were jubilant celebrations and popping champagne corks . in the coming months , the collider is expected to begin smashing particles into each other by sending two beams of protons around the tunnel in opposite directions . skeptics , who claim that the experiment could lead to the creation of a black hole capable of swallowing the planet , failed in a legal bid to halt the project at cern , the european organization for nuclear research . others have branded it a colossal waste of cash , draining resources from its multinational collaborators that could have been spent on scientific research with more tangible benefits to mankind . sound off : what do you think of the experiment ? french president nicolas sarkozy hailed the project as a major achievement for europe . `` the repercussions of this scientific investment without precedent in the history of humanity will be essential not only for the intimate knowledge of our universe , but also for the direct applications in fields as varied as intensive calculation or even medicine , '' he said . watch as big bang experiment gets underway '' the collider will operate at higher energies and intensities in the next year , potentially generating enough data to make a discovery by 2009 , experts say . they say the experiment has the potential to confirm theories that physicists have been working on for decades including the possible existence of extra dimensions . they also hope to find a theoretical particle called the higgs boson -- sometimes referred to as the `` god particle , '' which has never been detected , but would help explain why matter has mass . the collider will recreate the conditions of less than a millionth of a second after the big bang , when there was a hot `` soup '' of tiny particles called quarks and gluons , to look at how the universe evolved , said john harris , u.s. coordinator for alice , a huge detector specialized to analyze that question . since this is exploratory science , the collider may uncover surprises that contradict prevailing theories , but which are just as interesting , said joseph lykken , theoretical physicist at the fermi national accelerator laboratory . `` when columbus sails west , he thought he was going to find something . he did n't find what he thought he was going to find , but he did find something interesting , '' said lykken , who works on the compact muon solenoid , one of six experiments inside the collider complex . why should the layperson care about this particular exploration ? years ago , when electrons were first identified , no one knew what they were good for , but they have since transformed our entire economy , said howard gordon , deputy research program manager for the collider 's atlas experiment . `` the transformative effect of this research will be to understand the world we live in much better , '' said gordon , at brookhaven national laboratory . `` it 's important for just who we are , what we are . '' fears have emerged that the collider could produce black holes that could suck up anything around them -- including the whole earth . such fears prompted legal actions in the u.s. and europe to halt the operation of the large hadron collider , alleging safety concerns regarding black holes and other phenomena that could theoretically emerge . although physicists acknowledge that the collider could , in theory , create small black holes , they say they do not pose any risk . a study released friday by cern scientists explains that any black hole created would be tiny , and would not have enough energy to stick around very long before dissolving . five collider collaborators who did not pen the report independently told cnn there would be no danger from potential black holes . john huth , who works on the collider 's atlas experiment , called such fears `` baloney '' in a recent interview , and noted that in normal physics , even if the black hole were stable , it could just pass through the earth without being detected or without interacting at all . `` the gravitational force is so weak that you 'd have to wait many , many , many , many , many lifetimes of the universe before one of these things could -lsb- get -rsb- big enough to even get close to being a problem , '' said huth , professor of physics at harvard university . cnn 's elizabeth landau contributed to this story .

925	la paz , bolivia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- five of bolivia 's nine states staged a civic strike tuesday , protesting against president evo morales and demanding a larger share of the country 's natural gas revenues . members of santa cruz 's juvenile union burn wood during protests tuesday in santa cruz , bolivia . officials in santa cruz , beni , pando , tarija -- states in the wealthy , eastern lowland known as the `` media luna , '' or half-moon -- and chuquisaca , also in the eastern part of the country , instructed residents not to leave their homes until the end of the one-day strike , bolivian newspaper el diario reported . the five departments contain much of the andean country 's natural gas deposits , and their leaders are asking for natural gas revenue that morales has earmarked to increase funding for pension plans , the five regions said in a statement on the strike posted on santa cruz 's web site . they said they were `` sorry that the inflexibility of the government forced the prefectures to take this type of resolution . '' confrontations between government supporters and pro-autonomy groups in a santa cruz neighborhood appeared to be the day 's most violent . police fired tear gas three times at demonstrators . in the other four departments where the strike was being observed , there were no disturbances . the 24-hour strike was called by civil committees of the departments to demand that the government give back the money it has collected by taxing hydrocarbons in order to fund the pension plan . the president of santa cruz 's civic committee , branco marincovick , said the tax is constraining regional development . the government condemned acts of violence during the day and said that the strike was limited . the strike comes nine days after morales garnered more than 67 percent of votes in a recall referendum , which he had proposed in may to break a power struggle long simmering between him and the conservative leadership in the media luna states . despite the solid show of support for morales , the vote also endorsed the leaders in santa cruz , pando , beni and tarija , making it impossible to reach a solution to the stalemate . morales , a former labor organizer and the country 's first indigenous president , was elected in 2005 on promises to reform bolivia 's constitution for the benefit of its indigenous majority . but his proposals have been hampered by his rivals in the media luna states . since taking office , all four have pushed for greater autonomy , saying the individual departments have the right to control their own affairs , including increased access to gas revenues . in speaking about the revenues earmarked for increased pensions , morales emphasized that it was for the good of the people , a refrain he often uses . `` some authorities believe that this money is theirs , and it is not so , this silver is of the people and should benefit the people , '' the president said last year , shortly after he announced the measure . mark weisbrot , co-director of the washington-based center for economic and policy research , a nonpartisan think-tank , said morales ' overwhelming victory at the polls strengthens his hand at achieving his goal of redistributing wealth . less than one percent of landowners in bolivia own two-thirds of the country 's farmland , he said in an article published in the nation magazine . `` bolivia is south america 's poorest country , with 60 percent of the population living below the poverty line , and 38 percent in extreme poverty , '' he said . `` the voters have overwhelmingly decided that they want their government to do something about that . this should be possible , even if it means redistributing some of the country 's most important natural resources .

927	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- rare images of an african animal so elusive that it was once believed to be mythical have been released . one of the first pictures of the elusive okapi was taken by camera trap . the okapi is a shy animal related to the giraffe , with zebra-like stripes on its rear . it is native to the tropical rainforests of africa but is now known to live only in the democratic republic of the congo . okapis were last seen in the drc 50 years ago , and the images are the first to capture the animal in the wild . `` to have captured the first-ever photographs of such a charismatic creature is amazing , '' said noelle kumpel , manager of the bushmeat and forests conservation program at the zoological society of london , which took the pictures . `` okapi are very shy and rare animals , which is why conventional surveys only tend to record droppings and other signs of their presence . '' the okapi 's face and long legs resemble those of the giraffe , their closest-living relative , but they look more like horses with long necks . the average height of their shoulders is 1.6 meters -lrb- 5 feet , 3 inches -rrb- , the zsl says . they have a short , dense , velvety coat and dark prehensile tongue long enough to clean their own eyelids and ears . the new pictures show the okapi in the foliage of the drc 's virunga national park , where decades of economic collapse and armed conflict have threatened the diverse wildlife . in one image , an okapi looks curiously toward the camera amid the green trees and groundcover . its large ears , dark nose , and zebra stripes are clearly visible . the next shot shows the okapi walking away from the camera , giving a clear view of its striking black-and-white stripes on its rear legs . a third image released by zsl was taken at night and gives a vivid side view of the animal . `` the photographs clearly show the stripes on their rear , which act like unique fingerprints , '' said theirry lusenge , a key member of zsl 's survey team in the drc . `` we have already identified three individuals , and further survey work will enable us to estimate population numbers and distribution in and around the park , which is a critical first step in targeting conservation efforts . '' zsl said the images prove the okapi still thrives in the park despite threats to its survival , which include poaching , deforestation , military camps inside the park , and the influx of refugees at the park 's borders . the animal 's exact status is still a mystery , however , and it remains under threat , the zsl said . okapi meat reportedly poached from the park is now regularly on sale at the nearby town of beni -- and if hunting continues at the same rate , okapi could become extinct within the park within a few years , the zsl said . the virunga national park is one of only three protected areas the okapi are known to inhabit , the zsl said . the zsl 's study of the okapi is part of a larger eu-funded conservation project in the park . though focused on okapi , the study has also managed to find other species including shrews and duikers , a kind of antelope , a zsl spokeswoman said . the study involved 18 cameras set up around the park by the zsl and the congolese institute for nature conservation , the spokeswoman said . the announcement comes a month after another group of researchers reported finding thousands of previously-unknown gorillas in the neighboring republic of congo . the u.s.-based wildlife conservation society said in august they had found 125,000 western lowland gorillas living in a swamp in northern congo , adding significantly to the existing worldwide population of the threatened species . okapi were well known by africans for centuries but the animal remained elusive , thanks to its acute hearing and effective camouflage , according to the national zoological gardens of south africa . nineteenth-century explorers sometimes caught a fleeting glimpse of the okapi 's striped backside as it ran through the forest , leading to speculation that it was a kind of zebra , the national zoological gardens says . it was known to the pygmy as a sacred animal . still , the okapi remained unknown to the western world until the early 20th century , when british explorer harry johnston went to congo and sent a complete skin and skull back to britain , the zsl said .

943	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- hillary clinton 's campaign has apologized for `` inappropriate '' language used by her husband in response to what it called an `` outrageously unfair '' article about the former president . bill and hillary clinton campaign in sioux falls , south dakota , on monday . the article , by vanity fair magazine 's national editor todd purdum , suggested that bill clinton 's personality had changed since his 2004 heart bypass surgery and said that there were reports of clinton `` seeing a lot of women on the road . '' purdum quoted four anonymous former clinton aides saying that another of his former assistants had conducted `` what one of these aides called an intervention '' about the reports of philandering . a writer for the huffington post , mayhill fowler , asked clinton on monday what he thought `` about that hatchet job somebody did on you in vanity fair , '' according to a recording of the exchange posted on the huffington post 's web site . listen to clinton call the reporter a `` scumbag '' '' '' -lsb- he 's -rsb- sleazy , '' clinton responded . `` he 's a really dishonest reporter . '' clinton said he had not read the article but that he was told that `` there 's five or six just blatant lies in there . but he 's a real slimy guy . '' watch larry king panel debate bill clinton 's response '' calling purdum a `` scumbag , '' clinton said `` he 's one of the guys that propagated all those lies about whitewater for kenneth starr . he 's just a dishonest guy -- ca n't help it . '' purdum `` did n't use a single name , he did n't cite a single source in all those things he said , '' said the former president , who added that the article was `` part of the national media 's attempt to nail hillary for -lsb- barack -rsb- obama . '' he said readers should be wary of news accounts that rely on unnamed sources . `` anytime you read a story that slimes a public figure with anonymous quotes , it ought to make the bells go off in your head , '' he said . late monday , jay carson , a spokesman for hillary clinton 's campaign , said that `` president clinton was understandably upset about an outrageously unfair article , but the language today was inappropriate and he wishes he had not used it . '' purdum , a former new york times reporter who covered the clinton white house and is now married to former clinton press secretary dee dee myers , defended his article on cnn 's `` the situation room '' monday . he told cnn 's wolf blitzer he was `` very careful to say there is no clear-cut evidence that president clinton has done anything improper . '' watch cnn 's wolf blitzer interview purdum '' `` i reject the notion that i 'm making an insinuation , '' purdum said . `` but i 'm very comfortable quoting the people i quote because i know who they are , and i know that they are very senior people who have known president clinton for a very long time and work for him at very high levels . '' in his article , purdum quotes a johns hopkins cardiologist -- who was not involved in clinton 's health care -- who says that the former president 's bypass surgery could have affected his mood , perhaps even causing depression . and on cnn , purdum quoted `` some people who work for him '' saying that clinton `` seems to be angry all the time . '' purdum added he himself believes there 's evidence the former president is acting in a different manner . `` i think there 's a good deal of evidence that he is quite a bit angrier than he used to be , '' he said . `` he 's clearly very angry at the media , and he 's very angry at the way he sees sen. clinton 's campaign has been treated . '' `` i do n't suggest that anyone can say -- except perhaps his own doctors over time -- with certainty that -lsb- the surgery -rsb- has affected president clinton , '' he said . `` but again , this article involves reporting with a whole bunch of people who have worked for bill clinton over many years . and this is one of the things they raised with me . i did n't go raising this . '' clinton 's office issued a rebuttal of purdum 's article that decried his use of `` one doctor who has never examined president clinton . '' `` this theory is false and is flatly rejected by president clinton 's doctors who say he is in excellent shape and point to his vigorous schedule as evidence of his exceptional recovery , '' the rebuttal said . watch analyst james carville 's take on the article '' the lengthy article hits newsstands later this week , though vanity fair has already posted a copy on its web site . the posting prompted a blistering response from carson , who called the piece `` journalism of personal destruction at its worst . '' `` a tawdry , anonymous quote-filled attack piece , published in this month 's vanity fair magazine regarding former president bill clinton repeats many past attacks on him , ignores much prior positive coverage , includes numerous errors , and ultimately breaks no new ground , '' he said . purdum last year wrote an article about efforts by sen. john mccain , now the presumptive republican nominee for president , to draw in the party 's more conservative voters . cnn 's alex mooney contributed to this report .
944	harare , zimbabwe -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- zimbabwe 's inflation rate has soared in the past three months and is now at 11.2 million percent , the highest in the world , according to the country 's central statistical office . zimbabwe 's inflation rate has soared to a world high . official figures dated monday show inflation has surged from the rate of 2.2 million percent recorded in may , despite the government 's price controls . the country 's finance minister confirmed the new figure in an interview but said the rising inflation rate was not confined to zimbabwe alone . `` while our case has been aggravated by the illegal sanctions imposed by the western powers , rising food prices are a world phenomenon because of the use of bio-fuel , '' said samuel mumbengegwi . `` but we will continue to fight inflation by making sure that prices charged are realistic . '' in february , the price of a loaf of bread in the country was less than 200,000 zimbabwe dollars . on monday , that same loaf of bread cost 1.6 trillion zimbabwe dollars . analysts have said the zimbabwean government 's official inflation rate figures are conservative . last week , one of zimbabwe 's leading banks , kingdom bank , said the country 's inflation rate was now more than 20 million percent . the locally-owned bank predicted tougher times ahead for zimbabwe in the absence of donor support and foreign investment in an economy that has been in freefall for almost a decade . once considered the breadbasket of africa , zimbabwe has been in the throes of an economic meltdown ever since the country embarked on a chaotic land reform program that has decimated commercial agriculture . analysts say the crisis has worsened following president robert mugabe 's disputed reelection in the june 27 presidential run-off . his challenger morgan tsvangirai boycotted the race over widespread allegations of violence and voter intimidation . the economic crisis has destroyed zimbabwe 's currency and made it difficult for zimbabweans to buy basic commodities , electricity , fuel , and medicines . many zimbabweans have left the country amid rising unemployment and deepening poverty . last week a summit in south africa of regional african leaders failed to persuade zimbabwe 's political parties to agree to form a government of national unity , which observers view as the best way to end zimbabwe 's record recession .
945	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- six people were killed and 13 wounded in the shelling of south ossetia by georgian forces , south ossetian officials said saturday , according to russia 's interfax news agency . officials of the breakaway georgian region said the shelling was part of a georgian military operation , interfax reported . georgia initially suggested russian peacekeepers were to blame , drawing heated denials from the russian defense ministry , which called the allegation `` dirty informational provocation . '' later , however , mamuka kurashvili , the commander of georgian peacekeeping operations , told reporters that four people were wounded when several georgian villages were fired upon from south ossetia , and georgia `` had to return fire . '' women , children and the elderly were being evacuated from the conflict zone because of fears that georgia would continue military operations against the region , according to the south ossetian information and press committee as reported by interfax . south ossetia 's government held a special session on the violence , the russian news agency said . `` if georgia continues provocative actions , we will announce the recruitment of volunteers not only in the north ossetia but in the entire north caucasus and also carry out general mobilization in south ossetia , '' south ossetian leader eduard kokoity told interfax . georgia , located on the black sea coast between russia and turkey , has been split by russian-backed separatist movements in south ossetia and another region , abkhzia . accusations often fly on both sides , and the south ossetian leadership has alleged that georgian troops stage attacks to create a pretext for military action . south ossetia declared its independence from georgia in the early 1990s after a bloody war there between ethnic georgians and ossetians . the region 's independence is not internationally recognized . russian , georgian and south ossetian troops participate in a mixed peacekeeping force there and have maintained a fragile peace broken occasionally by fighting . on friday , as reports of the shelling began , russia expressed `` its most serious concern about the escalation of tensions in south ossetia . '' moscow said it was taking measures to prevent escalation of the conflict as it urged both georgia and south ossetia to look for diplomatic ways to calm the situation .
946	new delhi , india -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- three weeks after an apparent misunderstanding sparked a confrontation , deadly hindu-christian riots continue unabated in the remote east indian state of orissa . police officers chase away a protester in mangalore , india , monday . by tuesday , about 20 deaths had been reported , said praveen kumar , the superintendent of police in the worst-affected kandhamal district . the latest casualty is a police officer who died after an armed mob of about 400 to 500 mostly hindus torched a police station in the district on monday , orissa state police said . orissa 's director general of police g.c. nanda the policeman died when the mob opened fire at officers fleeing the burning building . the attack , he said , may have been in retaliation for arrests that police made in the ongoing communal fighting . watch more about the riots in india '' the attack came two days after police fired on a crowd to prevent it from attacking christian residents . between three and six people died in the shooting , cnn 's sister network cnn-ibn reported . the violence spread to southern india over the weekend when vandals attacked 14 churches in an hour in the state of karnataka sunday , the network said . the christian community in the karnataka -- numbering about 2.5 million -- said right-wing hindus are targeting them for opposing the violence in orissa . by tuesday , police had arrested about 140 people in connection with the riots , said karnataka 's inspector general of police a.m. prasad . sixty of them -- all hindus -- were arrested for the church attacks , prasad said . the rest , mostly christians , were charged with disturbing the peace , he said . orissa has historically been a tinderbox of hindu-christian tensions . some hindu groups view the work of christian missionaries in the state with suspicion . they accuse missionaries of bribing or forcing hindus into converting . the seeds for the current conflict were planted on august 23 , when hindu leader , laxmananda saraswati , and four others were killed in kandhamal after 20 to 30 gunmen barged into a hindu school and began shooting , the orissa chief minister 's office said . the authorities have not determined who killed saraswati , but after the incident they detained five people who are christians , said sukanta panda , spokesman for the chief minister . the government says the killings may have been the work of maoist rebels -- investigators have many unanswered questions -- but some hardline hindus blamed a christian minority . they took to the streets in anger , rampaging through predominantly christian neighborhoods , ransacking shops and torching houses . they chopped down trees to block roads , making it difficult for police to reach trouble spots . a christian orphanage was set on fire . a 20-year-old woman , who was teaching children inside , burned to death . christian residents fought back , and the clashes spread . authorities imposed a night curfew in many towns and deployed state and federal forces in the troubled areas , kumar -- the police superintendent -- said . both sides said the violence has left christian churches and hindu temples razed to the ground . this is not the first time the simmering anger has boiled over in the state with deadly consequences . in 1999 , a hindu mob burned to death an australian missionary , graham staines , and his two children while they slept inside their car . and last christmas , clashing groups killed four people and burned several churches in the same orissa district -- kandhamal . maoist rebels , who claim to be fighting for the poor and the dispossessed , have been battling the indian government in an insurgency that has resulted in thousands of casualties since the late 1960s . some christians accept the maoist theory , saying the rebels have also struck against hard-line hindus because they associate them as being closely aligned with the government . but hindu groups insists that christians were behind saraswati 's death . unlike orissa , karnataka has until now been spared the large-scale clash between christians and hindus . but now , many in the christian community fear their calm and prosperous state may become another battleground between the two religions , cnn-ibn said . cnn 's harmeet singh contributed to this report .

'' his wife sobs as she says her stepson 's death was foreshadowed by a phone call he made to her from iraq . `` he said that he was more shaky sometimes of the soldiers than of the enemy , because of the young guys over there . '' she said she asked him , `` what in the world do you mean ? you 're afraid of your own soldiers ? '' '' ` these kids are trying to fight a war they know nothing about . ... they 're jumpy . ... they 're more scary than the enemy , ' '' she said he told her . `` and i said , ` oh , god , ' '' said maxine mathis . on any given day , cnn receives dozens of detailed news releases from the u.s. military , including those announcing u.s. military casualties . in the cases of dawson and durbin , there was no mention of their names , and the releases were terse . `` a multi-national division center soldier died this morning of non-combat related causes , '' the first release read . `` the cause of death is under investigation . '' a second release came later in the day . `` a second multi-national division center soldier died this morning of non-combat related causes . the solider died of wounds september 14 at a coalition forces combat army support hospital , '' it read . `` the incident is under investigation . '' inquiries thursday from cnn were met with a news release that a press officer said had been drafted wednesday . however , the release had not been e-mailed to reporters wednesday , as is customary . after naming the two soldiers and giving their rank and unit , it reads , `` a u.s. soldier is in custody in connection with the shooting deaths . he is being held in custody pending review by a military magistrate . the incident continues under investigation . '' the release gives no other details . the u.s. military is classifying the death of sgt. dawson as `` non-hostile , '' something dawson 's father finds puzzling . `` i do n't know . i really do n't know , '' he said . `` i just ca n't get it together with that . i had never heard that before . ` non-hostile ' in a war zone ? '' lt. col. paul swiergosz is a public affairs officer for the area in iraq where the incident took place . he says the `` non-hostile '' death classification was given `` because the deaths were not the result of hostile enemy action . '' but details on what happened remain scarce . after asking , cnn received an e-mail press release from gen. tony cucolo , commanding general of the third infantry division that a press officer said had been drafted on wednesday . the release , however , had not been e-mailed to reporters , as is customary . `` we do know one soldier , a fellow noncommissioned officer , allegedly opened fire and mortally wounded his squad leader and fellow team leader , '' reads the statement . a spokesman at fort stewart in georgia said , `` a soldier has been taken into custody . the incident is under investigation , and that is all i can say . '' the spokesman would not even confirm information in his commanding general 's press statement . maxine mathis says she is stunned at how her stepson 's death has been handled by the military . she says the army assigned someone to help the family with anything they needed once they found out darris had been killed , but she and her husband do n't know how he died . she said her husband asked the liaison officer whether it was true that darris had been killed by another u.s. solider . she said the officer denied it , insisting he did n't know anything else . darryl mathis continues to express his disappointment in the lack of information from the military about his son , amid rumors his son 's body could be home by saturday . `` i do n't even know where he 's at , at this time , '' he said . bobby muller , president of veterans for america , said he thinks the way the military classifies deaths in iraq is an attempt to keep the public combat numbers down . `` there is a clear and long-standing record , regarding the classification of causalities in iraq to minimize combat losses . and we 're seeing people wounded and killed that would have well been considered casualties from hostile action in previous conflicts . it 's an attempt to conceal the actual cost of this war in terms of casualties , '' muller said . `` the department of defense has announced the death of every service member who has given their life in operation iraqi and enduring freedom , '' said a pentagon spokesman , col. gary keck . `` we have been open and transparent on the numbers of casualties suffered in these operations . '' mathis says his son wanted to come home to his wife and four young children and was in the process of applying for a transfer . `` last i spoke to him was last week monday . he called every monday , and said he was checking his paperwork . he said he was going to call me back once he found out . that was the last i heard from him .

949	buenos aires , argentina -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- when susana trimarco 's daughter marita veron was 23 , she vanished from their hometown in argentina , a suspected victim of a human trafficking and prostitution ring with links throughout latin america and europe . marita veron , who is missing , hugs her daughter micaela . police believe marita was forced into sexual slavery . trimarco , 54 , has spent the past 6 1/2 years searching for her daughter , often putting herself at risk . while chasing down leads on marita 's whereabouts , she 's entered dark and dangerous brothels and confronted pimps and politicians who , she says , are complicit in her daughter 's disappearance . she has won accolades throughout latin america , europe and the united states for her work . but marita is nowhere to be found . `` marita is a wonderful and caring girl . my life will be completely absorbed with this fight until she is back and safe , '' trimarco said . on april 3 , 2002 , veron left her house in the northern argentine province of tucuman early for a doctor 's appointment . she was wearing a turquoise shirt , blue jeans and old white sneakers . as she left the house , she told her mother , `` do n't worry . i 'll be back soon . '' those were the last words the two exchanged . the investigation that has followed has led police and trimarco to believe that she was kidnapped and forced into prostitution , either in rural argentina or spain . so far , a series of random clues has failed to provide any concrete information on marita 's whereabouts . now , art is imitating life on argentina 's airwaves . trimarco 's story has become the basis of one of argentina 's most popular nighttime soap operas , `` vidas robadas , '' or `` stolen lives . '' watch art imitate activism '' the program premiered in march on telefe , one of argentina 's largest television networks , to a lukewarm response . but as the storyline and characters evolved and word started to spread , the audience grew , and it became water-cooler television . `` stolen lives '' attracts more than 2 million viewers nightly , a considerable feat considering argentina 's population is only 40 million . the show 's plot centers on widowed anthropologist bautista amaya -lrb- played by facundo arana -rrb- and rosario soler -lrb- soledad silveyra -rrb- -- the mother of a young kidnapped girl , based on trimarco -- who team up to unravel an underground prostitution ring . `` with every performance , i try to display the inner feelings of this woman who is suffering , to transmit her grief , '' silveyra said . `` as an actress , i feel an enormous responsibility . '' the usual telenovela themes of love , passion and revenge are ever present in `` stolen lives , '' but the show strives to expose an issue that has remained in the dark in argentina until recently . human rights groups in argentina estimate that 800 women have gone missing at the hands of human traffickers since 2007 . worldwide , about 800,000 people are trafficked across borders annually , according to the u.s. state department . `` i am delighted that the show has been able to bring this topic to light , because no one ever talked about human trafficking in argentina before , '' trimarco said . `` stolen lives '' is the latest in a series of recent argentine telenovelas that dissect important social issues while also aiming to entertain . one of the most important was the 2006 hit `` montecristo , '' which examined crimes against humanity committed by argentina 's military during the 1970s and 1980s . local versions of `` montecristo '' are produced in nine countries around the globe , including turkey , portugal , mexico and russia . `` with these types of telenovelas , we are able to bring something entirely new to the public debate . and because we take a take a fictional and not a journalistic approach , we are able to attract and keep more viewers , '' telefe programming director claudio villarruel said . `` montecristo '' helped reunite children of argentina 's dirty war who `` disappeared '' with lost family members . the dirty war happened from 1976-83 , when the government carried out a secret campaign to purge the country of those it considered to be dissidents . `` stolen lives '' is making a similarly strong impact . trimarco established a foundation in her daughter 's honor , fundacion maria de los angeles , last year in tucuman . it counts u.s. ambassador to argentina earl wayne and argentine president cristina fernandez de kirchner among its supporters . according to trimarco , the foundation has rescued 360 women and children from trafficking networks , and leads on missing people continue to pour in . argentina passed its first national law against human trafficking this year , a law that trimarco lobbied hard to get passed . meanwhile , praise rings from home and abroad . in may , `` stolen lives '' was declared a show of `` social interest '' by the buenos aires city legislature . in 2007 , trimarco received the u.s. state department 's `` international women of courage award '' from secretary of state condoleezza rice at a ceremony in washington . later this year , trimarco will travel to spain to speak about human trafficking with lawmakers from the european union . `` it 's just like condoleezza rice told me : my screams are being heard all over the world , '' she said . trimarco travels around argentina constantly , educating people about human trafficking , and following up on clues about marita . she is also raising marita 's daughter , micaela , 9 . with all the publicity surrounding the case and the success of `` stolen lives , '' trimarco has herself become a target . her accusations of political and police involvement have led to death threats , she says . still , she remains committed to the cause and says that collaborating with the producers of `` stolen lives '' to tell her story has helped give her the strength to continue searching for her daughter . `` i 'm content , because my pain is now serving a purpose , '' she said .
950	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- gov. david paterson of new york has told state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed in states and countries where they are legal , his spokeswoman said wednesday . the governor 's legal counsel told state agencies in a may 14 memo to revise policies and regulations to recognize same-sex marriages performed in california and massachusetts as well as canada and other countries that allow gays and lesbians to marry , said erin duggan , the governor 's spokeswoman . the memo informed state agencies that failing to recognize gay marriages would violate the new york 's human rights law , duggan said . the directive follows a february ruling from a new york state appeals court . that decision says that legal same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions are entitled to recognition in new york . `` this was in direct response to a court ruling , '' duggan told cnn . `` just to make sure all the state agencies are on the same page . '' see what rules your state has about same-sex unions '' duggan says that the court 's decision was consistent with the findings of several lower courts in new york state . the governor 's legal counsel sent the memo one day before the california supreme court struck down a ban on gay marriage in that state . court officials in california counties may begin issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples on june 17 , state officials said wednesday . massachusetts legalized same-sex marriages in 2004 , and gay couples need not be state residents there to wed. . however , then-gov . mitt romney resurrected a 1913 law barring non-resident marriages in the state if the marriage would be prohibited in the partners ' home state . subsequent court and agency decisions have determined that only residents of massachusetts , rhode island and new mexico may marry in massachusetts , unless the parties say they plan to move there after the marriage . new hampshire , vermont , new jersey and connecticut permit civil unions , while california has a domestic-partner registration law . more than a dozen other states give same-sex couples some legal rights , as do some other countries .
951	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- britain 's prince william is starting a two-month attachment with the royal navy on monday , part of the future king 's continued experience with various branches of the military , the ministry of defense said saturday . prince william and his father , prince charles , at his graduation from the royal air force in april . william , 25 , will spend the first part of his attachment on a basic sea safety course training in sea survival , firefighting and ship damage repair , according to the ministry . if william passes the course , as expected , he will join the hms iron duke in the caribbean , the department said . the ship 's function is to support overseas british territories in the event of a hurricane and to carry out counter-narcotic operations . the prince , who will be called sub lieutenant wales in the navy , is expected to spend time aboard a frigate , a mine hunter , a submarine and helicopters during his attachment , which ends august 1 , the ministry of defense said . william completed a four-month attachment with the royal air force this year and received his pilot 's wings upon graduating in april . he learned to fly three different aircraft during the attachment and is known as flying officer wales within the raf . william is also a second lieutenant in the british army , where he serves in the blues and royals regiment of the household cavalry . the attachments are designed to provide the prince with military experience for when he becomes head of the armed forces as king . `` when he becomes king , he needs to know his armed forces -- instinctively be very familiar with them -- and so he is doing this visit to the royal navy , '' said rear adm. bob cooling , the assistant chief of naval staff . william 's father , prince charles , had a five-year career in the navy in the 1970s . charles served on the guided missile destroyer hms norfolk and two frigates before qualifying as a helicopter pilot and joining a naval air squadron that operated from the aircraft carrier hms hermes . prince charles spent his last nine months in the navy in 1976 in command of the coastal minehunter hms bronington . william 's uncle prince andrew served 22 years in the royal navy as a helicopter pilot , seeing active service during the falklands war between britain and argentina in 1982 . queen elizabeth ii 's husband , prince philip , william 's grandfather , spent more than 13 years in the royal navy . he saw active service throughout world war ii and was in tokyo harbor when japan surrendered .

955	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- former illinois gov. george ryan and a co-defendant lost another legal round at the supreme court on tuesday and will remain in prison on federal racketeering and fraud convictions . ex-gov . george ryan walks out of a chicago , illinois , courthouse after his april 2006 conviction . ryan and businessman larry warner claimed they did not receive a fair trial , but the justices , without comment , refused to intervene in the case . justice john paul stevens refused last fall to grant bail for the 74-year-old ryan , a move that would have kept him out of jail to file more appeals . the disgraced ex-governor reported to a federal prison in wisconsin in november to serve a 6 1/2 - year sentence . the men were convicted in april 2006 for fraud in a case stemming from bribes paid for various state licenses . their lawyers claimed the trial judge improperly removed two jurors while deliberations in the case had commenced , but a federal appeals court upheld the convictions . ryan , a republican , served as governor from 1999 to 2003 . he retired following investigations into political corruption in his administration . he also was noted for issuing a moratorium on capital punishment in his state in 2000 over concerns innocent inmates might be executed . the case decided tuesday is warner and ryan v. u.s. -lrb- 07-977 -rrb- .
956	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the crib in ellen darcy 's boston home has sat empty for more than a year . and in suburban washington , laura teresinski has prepared a nursery for a baby that may never arrive . guatemala has announced it will conduct a case-by-case review of every pending foreign adoption case . they and thousands of prospective parents , eager to adopt children from abroad , have found themselves in an emotional legal limbo since two of the most popular countries for international adoptions -- guatemala and vietnam -- recently halted their programs . now would-be mothers and fathers around the united states wonder what will become of their quest to adopt a child -- a pursuit that can fray nerves , cost up to $ 30,000 and span several years . guatemala announced this month that it would conduct a case-by-case review of every pending foreign adoption case . that put on hold the adoption plans of about 2,000 american families . the crackdown comes amid reports that some in guatemala coerce mothers to relinquish their children for adoption -- or steal the children outright and present them as orphans . similar accusations have arisen in vietnam . after the united states accused adoption agencies there of corruption and baby-selling , vietnam said in april that it would no longer allow adoptions to the united states . `` my husband and i were absolutely devastated , '' teresinski said . `` adoptive parents have put a lot of emotional energy and a lot of financial resources in the process . '' vietnam 's decision affects several hundred families . families in the united states adopted 4,728 children from guatemala and 828 from vietnam last year . the halt in adoptions from those two nations unfolds against the backdrop of a dramatic rise in international adoptions in the united states . the number of foreign-born children adopted by u.s. families more than tripled from 1990 to 2004 , when it reached a high of 22,884 , though the figure has declined slightly each year since . in 2007 , the u.s. granted visas to 19,613 children so they could join an adoptive family in the united states , according to u.s. state department figures . about 70 percent of those children came from four countries : china , guatemala , russia and ethiopia . a few other countries have also halted foreign adoptions at various times , including kazakhstan and togo . yet the suspensions in vietnam and guatemala have had the biggest impact -- they 're two of the 10 countries that send the most children to adoptive homes in the unites states . fear of fraud stirs heartache . for darcy , the review seems more detrimental than helpful . her adopted daughter , carolina , remains in a guatemalan foster home with three dozen other babies . darcy worries that keeping carolina , now 15 months old , in a foster home will harm her early development . `` she 's not getting one-on-one care by a consistent caretaker , '' darcy said , adding later , `` nobody is looking at this as a violation of the kids ' human rights except for these -lrb- american -rrb- parents . '' guatemala , which until now has had little to no oversight of its foreign adoptions , has the highest per capita rate of adoption in the world . nearly one in 100 babies born in guatemala wind up living with adoptive parents in the united states , according to the u.s. consulate in guatemala . while adoptive parents in the united states undergo rigorous screening , adoptions in guatemala had been processed by notaries responsible for determining whether the babies were relinquished voluntarily . they also arrange foster care and handle paperwork -- notaries in latin america tend to have more legal training than notaries in the united states . both guatemalan and u.s. officials fear the system leads to practices such as paying birth mothers for children or , in some instances , coercion . officials in both countries say gaps in regulations and the high sums of money at play -- adoptions can cost up to $ 30,000 -- may have created unintended incentives in a country where the state department estimates that 80 percent of the population lives in poverty . the guatemalan government has said its review could take a month or longer . as for the american families , they can only wait . `` i think it 's overkill , '' said darcy , who was matched with carolina last march and was approved to adopt the girl last winter -- typically one of the last steps before the actual adoption is complete . `` no adoptive parent wants to adopt an abducted child -- a child that was n't voluntarily relinquished -- but to keep them as hostages is unacceptable , '' darcy said . guatemala plans reforms . u.s. officials say they sympathize with the parents , but that reviews like the one in guatemala are in the best interest of the children . `` we feel for them , it 's a tough situation , '' said a state department official who is not authorized to speak on the record . '' -lrb- but -rrb- they 'll have the comfort of knowing american parents in the future who adopt from guatemala will get children from a system that has all the safeguards in place so that children are not exploited , '' the official said . in the past , guatemala required birth mothers to sign a document in court saying they were relinquishing their child . they were not required to reveal their reasons . now the government may require the presence of the birth mother and child . the goal is to verify identification and make sure the mother is giving up her child voluntarily . cleaning up guatemala 's adoption system is a step toward complying with the standards of the hague convention on intercountry adoption , an international agreement that governs adoptions from one country to another . about 70 nations have signed the convention , which seeks to ensure legitimate foreign adoptions . the united states joined the international convention last year , and rules governing adoptions from one signatory nation to another took effect april 1 . the united states has stopped issuing visas to guatemalan children after that date , blocking their travel to america -- at least until concerns are addressed . `` we 're not pointing fingers at american parents , '' the state department official said . however , the review and changes in guatemala will ensure that it `` does not become a fertile ground for -lrb- wrongful -rrb- practices on any person , particularly children , who have not been orphaned . '' to offset corruption , the u.s. embassy has added its own requirement : that birth mothers appear with the baby to request a visa for the baby . in august , officials also began requiring two dna tests to confirm the identities of mother and child . still , the guatemalan solicitor general 's office has identified at least 80 cases of adoption irregularities , including baby stealing and false dna tests . and the guatemalan chief prosecutor 's office recently launched a criminal investigation into the two laboratories contracted to take dna samples from birth mothers and children . ` serious irregularities ' in vietnam . similar concerns of corruption recently emerged in vietnam , where investigators had found `` serious adoption irregularities , '' according to a report by the u.s. embassy in hanoi . documents had been forged or altered , the embassy said , and some parents were paid , tricked or forced into giving up their children for adoption . in some cases , the embassy said , children were offered for adoption without the knowledge or permission of their parents . the vietnamese government has denied the accusations . even so , it said in april that it would terminate its adoption agreement with the united states , saying it wo n't accept applications after july 1 . the program is scheduled to end september 1 . parents in the united states who were matched with an adoptive child in vietnam before july 1 will be allowed to adopt that child . prospective parents who had invested time and money , but had not been matched with an adoptive child , appear to be out of luck . private adoption agencies insist that nearly all adoptions from vietnam are problem-free , and they want the adoptions to continue . `` it 's hard to let go , because we know we can advocate for these children and make a real difference , '' said linda brownlee , executive director of the nonprofit adoption center of washington , which places children for adoption from russia , china , cambodia and vietnam . she hopes the united states and vietnam reach an agreement so that adoptions can continue . `` without it , i think children are going to be harmed . they are going to die needlessly , and there is going to be trafficking , '' brownlee said .
957	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a navy admiral engaged in sexual relations in the white house in 1990 with a federal employee whom he falsely told he was a widower , according to a report released friday by the defense department . rear adm. john stufflebeem was demoted and fired from his post as director of the navy staff . in march , when the report was submitted to pentagon officials , rear adm. john stufflebeem was demoted and fired from his post as director of the navy staff . stufflebeem told investigators he could n't remember the name of the woman he had an affair with . he also lied when he told investigators he did not engage in sexual relations with the woman , identified as `` jane doe , '' the defense department 's inspector general 's report said . jane doe , who was then unmarried and working for a federal agency , told the investigators the allegations were true , the report said . her supervisor and stufflebeem 's superiors supported her testimony . stufflebeem was convicted april 18 of making false official statements to investigators . after the hearing , called an admiral 's mast , he requested retirement . jane doe told investigators that she and stufflebeem began their affair on an overseas trip in 1989 , that the married admiral told her he was a widower who was raising his children as a single parent and that they had sexual relations several times , including once in a white house room reserved for `` military aides with overnight duties . '' she also told investigators that stufflebeem came to her home on the day in august 1990 when she learned he was married and that she called him `` scum , '' shut the door in his face and never spoke to him again . read the report -lrb- pdf -rrb- . `` we found ms. doe to be an extremely credible , candid and articulate witness who willingly participated in our interview with the knowledge and support of her husband , '' the report said . by contrast , the report said , stufflebeem 's testimony was `` inconsistent with the weight of the evidence , '' and `` it did not appear stufflebeem 's misstatements in these areas of testimony were inadvertent . '' at issue was stufflebeem 's removal from his post as a presidential aide in 1990 . stufflebeem testified that he initiated the request to leave his white house post because of `` close family personal problems . '' but his superiors testified that he was removed from the post because of his relationship with the woman -- and that he admitted the affair . jane doe 's supervisor told investigators that when she learned of the affair from doe , she confirmed stufflebeem 's marital status and told doe what she 'd learned . `` ms. doe 's reaction , according to the supervisor , was one of complete surprise and shock , '' the report said . the supervisor also said that she telephoned stufflebeem 's immediate supervisor to tell him of the affair and that when she called a few weeks later to follow up , the supervisor told her that `` everybody in town knew boomer was f ` ing some bimbo at the -lsb- federal agency -rsb- . '' stufflebeem , however , denied to investigators that he had a sexual relationship with jane doe , although he admitted to one kiss and said he had an `` inappropriate relationship '' with her because he told her about his marital problems . `` i did not have sex with this woman , '' he said during one of two interviews with investigators . although he told investigators he could not remember the woman 's name , he testified that he `` had to live with shame for a long time '' after the `` inappropriate relationship '' ended , that he was `` racked with guilt '' and `` had a terrible time getting myself right with my family . '' `` so i have had a great 18-year career since i left the white house , '' he said , according to the report . `` if this is the end of it , then i still leave a rewarded individual , thankful for the blessings that i have had . '' investigators found stufflebeem 's remarks inconsistent . `` in our view , comments regarding guilt , shame , and the end of a distinguished naval career are incongruous with a physical relationship limited to one kiss , '' they wrote in the report . this year , according to the report , the inspector general 's office provided stufflebeem with its preliminary findings : that he 'd provided `` false and misleading testimony '' regarding the nature of his relationship with jane doe , his inability to recall her name and his representation to her of himself as a widower . stufflebeem responded with a vehement denial . '' -lsb- i -rsb- find it extremely regrettable , in a case that has such far reaching implications for my career , that you have chosen to question my integrity , '' he wrote in a february 15 letter . `` the unfortunate truth in this case is that , as a result of lack of evidence to substantiate the allegation of a sexual relationship and in lieu of investigating the underlying allegations , you have chosen to accuse me of being untruthful as i defended myself against these allegations .

958	jakarta , indonesia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- indonesia will withdraw from the organization of petroleum exporting countries at the end of the year , the country 's energy minister told foreign journalists wednesday . indonesia has become a net importer of oil due to declining production levels . purnomo yusgiantoro said the move follows declining oil production levels in indonesia that have left the country a net importer of oil . `` in the future , if our production -lrb- comes -rrb- back again to the level that gives us a status as a net oil exporter , then i think we can go back to opec again , '' he said . `` but today we decided that we are pulling out of opec . '' it was not immediately clear what effect indonesia 's decision will have on global oil prices . however the move was not unexpected . indonesia , which joined opec in 1962 , is the only southeast asian country in the 13-nation oil cartel . oil production there has steadily decreased in the last decade because of disappointing exploration efforts and declining production , according to the u.s. energy information administration . since 1996 , total production has dropped by 32 percent . the country 's current output quota for crude oil as set by opec is 1.45 million barrels a day -- well above its production capacity . in 2006 , indonesia imported more oil than it exported . cnn 's kathy quiano contributed to this report .
959	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- authorities have re-arrested three men in connection with the disappearance of an alabama teenager in aruba in 2005 , based on new evidence in the case , prosecutors announced wednesday . natalee holloway disappeared while on an aruba vacation in 2005 . brothers deepak and satish kalpoe were arrested in aruba at the same time authorities in the netherlands picked up joran van der sloot at the request of the aruban government , the statement said . van der sloot is attending school in holland . the three had previously been arrested in 2005 , aruban prosecutors noted in a statement , but a court released them , citing insufficient evidence . they are now charged with `` involvement in the voluntary manslaughter of natalee holloway or causing serious bodily harm to natalee holloway , resulting in her death , '' the statement said . watch interview with holloway 's father '' van der sloot , now 20 , and the kalpoes , now ages 24 and 21 , were the last people seen with holloway , 18 , as she left carlos n ' charlie 's nightclub in oranjestad , aruba , about 1:30 a.m. on may 30 , 2005 . all three men have maintained their innocence in her disappearance . view a timeline of the case '' no information was immediately available about what the new evidence was that led to the arrests . aruban prosecutors said a team of detectives from the netherlands has been reviewing the holloway case at the request of authorities in aruba , and had been on the island as late as last month to complete the investigation . the kalpoe brothers were being interrogated by aruban police wednesday , aruba prosecutor dop kruimel told cnn . they will appear before a judge friday for a preliminary arrest hearing , in which the judge determines whether the arrest was credible , she said . the judge can then authorize their being detained for eight more days , meaning police have that much time to produce evidence . the suspects then go before a judge again , she said . van der sloot was arrested in arnhem , the netherlands , by dutch police , kruimel said . aruban authorities have asked for him to be extradited to aruba within eight days . because they were not familiar with the case , dutch police were not questioning van der sloot , she said . he will be questioned when he is brought back to aruba , she said . however , he will appear before a judge thursday in arnhem . when cnn called the kalpoe household , the person who answered the phone hung up . earlier , van der sloot 's mother , anita van der sloot , told cnn her son had not been arrested , but had only reported to a police station in the netherlands for questioning wednesday after receiving a letter asking him to do so . anita van der sloot said she had spoken to her son briefly from her home in aruba . she said a dutch attorney was with him , and she expected him to appear before a judge and be released thursday . meanwhile , a spokeswoman for holloway 's mother , beth holloway , said in a statement , `` the family is always hopeful when a step in the right direction is made in the case . '' beth holloway was refusing interviews for now , said spokeswoman sunny tillman . she previously was known as beth holloway-twitty , but has returned to using holloway after a divorce earlier this year . natalee holloway was visiting aruba with a group of about 100 classmates celebrating their graduation from mountain brook high school in suburban birmingham , alabama , when she went to carlos n ' charlie 's that night in 2005 . the group had planned to leave for home the following day , and holloway 's packed bags and passport were found in her hotel room after she failed to show up for her flight . her disappearance triggered an exhaustive search and investigation and a media sensation in the united states , aruba , the netherlands and beyond , but holloway has never been found . aruban authorities have been criticized for their handling of the case . at least 10 men , including van der sloot and the kalpoes , have been arrested and identified as suspects either in holloway 's disappearance or in an alleged cover-up . all were questioned and released . legal experts , however , have said differences in the u.s. and aruban systems should be taken into account . aruba 's criminal justice system is based on dutch law and a descendant of the napoleonic code . in aruba , authorities ' reasonable suspicion that someone knows about or is involved in a crime is enough to make an arrest , while magistrates investigate and judges determine a suspect 's guilt or innocence . there are no jury trials . aruban authorities , meanwhile , have suggested that holloway may have overdosed on drugs or died of alcohol poisoning . beth holloway and natalee holloway 's father , dave holloway , filed a lawsuit last year against van der sloot and his father , aruban judge paulus van der sloot , in the supreme court of the state of new york . the van der sloots were served with the suit while on a trip to new york . however , a judge in august 2006 dismissed the suit , saying new york was an inconvenient forum in which to consider it . it was unclear whether holloway 's parents have pursued legal action elsewhere . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's kimberly segal and eric marrapodi contributed to this report .
960	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- two u.s. customs agents were arrested on charges they helped smuggle drugs and other contraband through new york 's john f. kennedy international airport . the dea says two customs officials at jfk international airport helped smuggle drugs and contraband . customs supervisor walter golembiowski and officer john ajello face narcotics , bribery and conspiracy charges in the case , according to the u.s. drug enforcement administration . golembiowski and ajello regularly solicited and accepted bribes to allow contraband to pass through undetected , the dea said . two airport workers and two others were also charged with importing counterfeit goods . some of those items included rolex , cartier and chanel watches and designer sunglasses , the dea said . on several occasions , golembiowski was captured on audio and video taking bribes to aid his co-conspirators in bringing in illegal drugs and counterfeit goods . `` smuggling any kind of illegal commodity raises troubling issues at a time of deep concern over national security , '' said michael j. garcia , the u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york . `` the threat is heightened when a government official accepts bribes to help smugglers breach our borders . '' the arrests came as a result of a lengthy sting operation by a state , local and federal task force . prosecutors said numerous recorded meetings and phone calls captured the suspects talking about plans to smuggle hashish , ecstasy and other illegal items . the investigation has led to the indictment and prosecution of more than 20 people -- `` from distributors to overseas sources of supply '' -- and the seizure of more than 600 pounds of imported hashish and other drugs from the united states and france , according to the statement .
961	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- more than 100 countries attending a conference in dublin , ireland formally adopted a treaty friday to ban cluster bombs -- a large , unreliable and inaccurate weapon that often affects civilians long after the end of armed conflict . cluster bombs are usually air-dropped shells that eject multiple small bomblets to kill enemy soldiers . a document released by ireland 's department of foreign affairs says the countries agreed never to use cluster munitions or the explosive bomblets they contain . the countries also agreed never to develop , acquire , retain or transfer cluster munitions . countries attending the 11-day conference agreed to the treaty wednesday but formally signed it friday . the accord calls for a total , immediate ban of the weapons , strong standards to protect those injured by them , contaminated areas to be cleaned up as quickly as possible and for the weapons to be immediately destroyed , he said . thomas nash , coordinator of the cmc campaigning organization , said wednesday : `` this is a great achievement for everyone who has been working hard to see the end of 40 years of suffering from these weapons . '' though some of the biggest makers of cluster bombs , including the united states , russia , china and israel , were not involved in the talks and have not signed the accord , organizers predicted that those nations would nevertheless be pressured into compliance . `` take the united states , '' nash said . `` almost all of its allies are here . they 've decided to ban these weapons . that 's going to make it extremely difficult , if not impossible , for the united states to ever use these weapons again , either on its own or in joint operations . '' the agreement requires the destruction of stockpiles of the weapons within eight years , he said . cluster munitions , which break apart in flight to scatter hundreds of smaller bomblets , are what the international committee of the red cross calls a `` persistent humanitarian problem . '' most of a cluster bomb 's bomblets are meant to explode on impact , but many do not . estimates show the weapons fail to explode on impact between 10 and 40 percent of the time , the red cross says . that means unexploded bomblets lie scattered across a target area , often exploding only when handled or disturbed -- posing a serious risk to civilians . last week , acting assistant secretary for political-military affairs stephen d. mull called it `` an absolute moral obligation '' to rid a battlefield of unexploded ordnance after the battle . but he also predicted that the united states would not agree to any ban . `` we think that it is going to be impossible to ban cluster munitions ... because these are weapons that have a certain military utility and are of use , '' mull said . `` the united states relies on them as an important part of our own defense strategy . '' instead , he urged that the weapons be regulated `` to take humanitarian considerations into account '' and that `` technological fixes '' be pursued that would render them harmless after a battle . during the 34-day war in lebanon in 2006 , the united nations estimated that israel dropped 4 million bomblets , 1 million of which may not have exploded , according to the international committee of the red cross . more than 250 civilians and bomb-disposal operators have been killed or injured by them in southern lebanon since the war ended . cluster bombs were also used in the 1999 war in kosovo . lt. col. jim burke , a military adviser to the irish defense forces said they quickly became a major killer of civilians . in more than 20 countries , according to the icrc , cluster bombs have created lasting `` no-go '' areas , rendering them as dangerous as minefields . laos is the most affected country . millions of bomblets dropped during the vietnam war continue to kill civilians more than three decades later . still , militaries consider cluster bombs important for use against multiple targets dispersed over a wide area , such as tanks or military personnel moving across the landscape . a single bomb containing hundreds of submunitions can cover more than 18 square miles . cnn 's jacqueline clyne contributed to this report .
962	lagos , nigeria -lrb- ap -rrb- -- a rebel group that has been attacking oil pipelines in southern nigeria claimed responsibility on monday for another strike and said it killed 11 government soldiers in fighting that followed the sabotage . a fire burns following an attack on a pipeline in nigeria in december 2006 . the nigerian military confirmed an attack on an oil pipeline and an explosion , but called the claim that 11 soldiers were killed a `` lie '' and `` pure propaganda . '' the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta , or mend , issued a statement saying it `` successfully sabotaged another major trunk pipeline '' belonging to the shell petroleum development company in the country 's rivers state . `` minutes after the sabotage , our fighters encountered a military gunboat which opened fire blindly on the advance guard . we flanked them in a counter-attack and killed in close combat all the drunken soldiers numbering eleven , collecting their weapons , ammunitions and bullet-proof vests before using dynamite to sink the gunboat with its dead occupants , '' mend said . mend also said they found two `` traumatized , adolescent girls '' who were gang-raped by nigerian soldiers . `` they were dropped off in the neighboring village by our men who have since returned safely to camp , '' the statement said . the military had no immediate response to that claim . analysts say that one reason for record high gas prices in the united states is a spate of attacks on oil pipelines in nigeria , the fourth largest supplier of oil to the united states . exxon and shell are two of several companies that had been extracting two million barrels of oil a day in nigeria . yet rebel attacks on oil pipelines in the niger delta have cut overall production by roughly 10 percent -- meaning 200,000 fewer barrels of oil on some days . the rebel group hopes to secure a greater share of oil wealth for people in the niger delta , where more than 70 percent of the population lives on less than a dollar a day . mend has bombed pipelines and kidnapped hundreds of foreign oil workers , typically releasing them unharmed , sometimes after receiving a ransom payment . the nigerian government has proposed a peace summit to find a solution to the region 's problems , but an immediate resolution does not appear in sight .

'' `` although hillary clinton has offered solid and sensible policy proposals , obama 's strike me as even more so , '' reich wrote on his blog . he served as the secretary of labor from 1993-1997 and is currently a professor at brandeis university . `` his plans for reforming social security and health care have a better chance of succeeding , '' reich continued . `` his approaches to the housing crisis and the failures of our financial markets are sounder than hers ... he has put forward the more enlightened foreign policy and the more thoughtful plan for controlling global warming . '' reich , whose relationship with the clintons dates back to their law school days at yale , has long been a critic of the new york senator 's white house bid . shortly before the iowa caucuses in january , he wrote that voters would have a choice `` between someone who talks the talk , and somebody who 's walked the walk . '' `` i do n't get it , '' he wrote then . `` if there 's anyone in the race whose history shows unique courage and character , it 's barack obama . hrc 's -lsb- hillary rodham clinton 's -rsb- campaign , by contrast , is singularly lacking in conviction about anything . '' reich also criticized bill clinton earlier in the year over the former president 's sharp attacks on obama in south carolina . `` bill clinton 's ill-tempered and ill-founded attacks on barack obama are doing no credit to the former president , his legacy , or his wife 's campaign , '' he wrote in january . `` nor are they helping the democratic party . '' asked to respond to reich 's endorsement , clinton spokesman mo eleithee said , `` did n't he endorse him last year ? '' reich is the latest former clinton administration official to announce his support for obama . last month , new mexico gov. bill richardson , who held several positions under bill clinton , also came out in support of the illinois senator . clinton supporter and cnn political analyst james carville later called that an `` act of betrayal . '' meanwhile , the obama campaign announced that former sens. sam nunn of georgia and david boren of oklahoma endorsed the illinois senator , and agreed to serve on the campaign 's national security policy team . nunn served 25 years in the senate and was chairman of the senate armed services committee from 1987 to 1995 . he said obama is `` our best choice to lead the nation . '' `` i believe that he will bring to the white house , high principles , clear vision and sound judgment , '' he added . boren -- who served in the senate from 1979 to 1994 and is the longest-serving chairman of the senate select committee on intelligence -- was one of bill clinton 's top choices to replace les aspes in 1994 as u.s. secretary of defense . he said obama is a person of `` sound and good judgement .

'' and sen. mitch mcconnell , r-kentucky , said he believes `` that the current stem cell policy has been very important in driving the discovery of ethical and successful ways for scientists to find treatments and cures . `` what has too often been missing from this important debate is a simple fact of modern science : encouraging medical research and protecting the sanctity of life are not mutually exclusive goals . '' the methods described in the papers about the new research `` should continue to be pursued and strongly promoted , as they should help to steer the entire field of stem cell research in a more explicitly ethical direction by circumventing the moral quagmire associated with destroying human embryos , '' said the national catholic bioethics center in philadelphia , pennsylvania , in a posting on its web site . but those views were not shared by sen. tom harkin , d-iowa , who has pushed for federal funding of embryonic stem cell research and said he will continue to do so . `` our top researchers recognize that this new development does not mean that we should discontinue studying embryonic stem cells , '' he said in a written statement . `` scientists may yet find that embryonic stem cells are more powerful . we need to continue to pursue all alternatives as we search for treatments for diabetes , parkinson 's and spinal cord injuries . '' he added that tuesday 's announcement `` reiterates the need for federal support for medical research and again points out the president 's misplaced priorities in vetoing the labor , health and human services , and education appropriations bill which included a substantial increase for the national institutes of health . '' a lead author of one of the landmark studies , james thomson of the university of wisconsin-madison , urged that reprogrammed cells not wholly supplant embryonic stem cells in research . `` i do n't like the idea of pulling the plug , '' he told reporters in a conference call . he added that tuesday 's advances in reprogramming cells would not have been possible without the advancements in embryonic stem cell research over the past decade . e-mail to a friend .

'' -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- can we all just stop the silly nonsense over who is an elitist and whether an `` average american '' will occupy the white house ? listening to the punditry today , you would think folks who revel in the comedy of larry the cable guy or katt williams really would have a shot at the white house . it 's totally absurd . so , sen. barack obama is all of a sudden an elitist because he went to columbia and harvard ? and sen. hillary clinton is an elitist because she went to yale ? do you actually think sen. john mccain is n't an elitist ? he went to an exclusive college -- the naval academy , and that is one of the hardest places to get into . -lrb- you ca n't even apply unless a member of congress recommends you . -rrb- . karl rove , who tries to portray himself as the common man but is just another rich republican , has called both democratic candidates elitists . well , his former boss , president george w. bush , went to yale . so did bush 's dad , former president george h.w. bush , and his granddaddy , former sen. prescott bush . all three bushes also were members of the super elite organization skull and bones . the younger bush later went to harvard . he walked into the governor 's mansion and the presidency on the strength of his name and his dad 's money and connections . sounds like an elitist to me ! but no , we 're supposed to be fooled by the cowboy boots , folksy charm and him removing brush at his crawford , texas , ranch -lrb- do n't forget the family compound in kennebunkport , maine , where all the `` regular '' folks hang out -rrb- . surely you recall when bush nominated harriet miers for the supreme court ? those same conservative voices decrying the elitist democrats were blasting her because she went to little old southern methodist university , that unremarkable -- their view -- university in dallas , texas . -lrb- by the way , that will be the home of the george w. bush library . -rrb- . you can bet a pitcher of beer that had she graduated from harvard , yale or princeton , she would n't have been derisively referred to as too plain and not educated enough by the elitists in the republican party . and let 's stay with the supreme court for a moment . where did its members go to school ? chief justice john g. roberts jr. -- undergrad and law school , harvard . justice john paul stevens -- undergrad : university of chicago . law school : northwestern . justice antonin scalia -- undergrad : georgetown university and the university of fribourg , switzerland . law school : harvard . justice anthony kennedy -- undergrad : stanford university and the london school of economics . law school : harvard . justice david souter -- undergrad : harvard ; magdalen college , oxford ; oxford university . law school : harvard . justice clarence thomas -- undergrad : holy cross . law school : yale . justice ruth ginsburg -- undergrad : cornell . law school : harvard -lrb- attended -rrb- ; finished at columbia . justice stephen breyer -- undergrad , stanford ; magdalen college , oxford . law school : harvard . justice samuel alito -- undegrad : princeton . law school : yale . that 's pretty much an elite list of schools . we have deluded ourselves into thinking the person elected to the white house is really and truly like the rest of us . all three candidates do n't know what it 's like to face the daunting health care challenges millions of americans are confronted with daily . each are members of the u.s. senate , and they have the best health care money can buy for life -- we pay for it ! while your pension plan is shot to hell , their plan will never be underfunded . the members will see to that , courtesy of taxpayer dollars . forget how many times obama bowls gutter balls , clinton tosses back shots of whiskey and mccain talks about how he 's a regular guy . each , courtesy of their $ 169,300 annual salary , makes far more than the average american . and when it comes to wealth , clinton gets to enjoy the $ 100 million she and her husband raked in since he left the white house -lrb- even their hefty book advances dwarf regular authors -rrb- . mccain 's wife , cindy , runs one of anheuser busch 's largest beer distributors and is worth more than $ 100 million . they will never be living paycheck-to-paycheck . obama is the poorest of the three , but he did earn more than a million bucks courtesy of his best-selling books , `` the audacity of hope '' and `` dreams from my father '' after delivering his 2004 keynote speech at the democratic national convention . how many average americans would n't mind having a million dollars in their savings account ? bottom line : the narrative about our presidential candidates being just regular folks is a tired myth that gets repeated each and every day . and their efforts to show that they are `` just like us '' are really pathetic . you do n't have to go duck hunting , be seen buying milk at the grocery store for your family or having a beer at the local bar to show that you 're `` one of us . '' just do what rich and highly educated folks do when they are in politics : advance policies that will at least allow me to keep a few more dollars in my pocket and be able to afford a home . one more thing : do n't buy fully into the nonsense tossed out by some of the loudest voices on television , radio and in print who decry these `` elitists '' and trumpet that they are for the blue collar , middle-class worker in middle america . many of them pull down multimillion-dollar salaries and run into these same candidates on martha 's vineyard and in the hamptons when they all vacation . they , too , will pull every favor they have to get their children in the posh private schools and ivy league institutions . yes , we even have elitists in the media . who would 've thunkit ? e-mail to a friend .
969	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- children from a polygamist sect who one mother says are `` hurting very badly '' in state custody are likely to be returned to their parents , a cnn legal analyst says . flds member margaret jessop says her children `` feel betrayed by adults . '' a texas appeals court ruled thursday that the state had no right to remove hundreds of children from the fundamentalist church of latter-day saints ' ranch in eldorado on april 3 , based on the suspicion that a few were being sexually abused . a sect mother who has four children in state custody said the matter has not been fully resolved because an appeal to the texas supreme court is possible . `` i 'm very grateful , but i 'd like to see the children in my arms before i rejoice greatly , '' margaret jessop said on cnn 's `` larry king live . '' watch jessop react to the ruling '' but a permanent reunion of families is likely , said jeffrey toobin , cnn senior legal analyst . `` based on this ruling i think it 's clear that if it stands , all these kids are going back with their mothers , '' toobin said on cnn 's `` anderson cooper 360 ° . '' jessop and other flds parents said they had been permitted visits with their children in foster care . zavenda young said two of her children were sent to waco , texas , and two to hockley , 148 miles away . `` they 're in boys and girls country in hockley . and it 's just a -- it 's an institution , '' she told host larry king . their father , edson jessop , said the experience has been rough on the children . `` you can see it 's a lot of stress on them , '' he said . `` every time we leave , they go through that trauma again . it 's enough to rip your heart out .

970	beirut , lebanon -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the fiery leader of lebanon 's hezbollah militant movement assured lebanon on monday that his movement will cooperate in the country 's political life . supporters carry posters of hezbollah chief hassan nasrallah . hassan nasrallah said : `` we do n't want to have control over lebanon , or to have governance over lebanon or to impose our ideas over the people of lebanon , because we believe lebanon to be a special and diverse country that needs the collaboration of everyone . '' nasrallah spoke a day after lebanon 's parliament elected michel sleiman the country 's president after a six-month vacancy in the position . nasrallah , speaking at a packed stadium , told his followers : `` i renew my appeal and invitation for a true national partnership with no eliminations or impositions . the national unity government is not the victory of the opposition against the pro-government . it is the victory of all lebanese . '' he said sleiman 's election `` renews the hope amongst the lebanese people to a new era and a new start . '' `` i must say that there are deep wounds from our side and theirs , we are both in front of two choices ; either to expand the wounds and add salt to them or try to cure them for the sake of lebanon and we prefer the second choice . '' the parliament had tried 19 times to vote on a new president , but failed because of disagreements over how to share power in a new cabinet . lebanon 's western-backed government and the hezbollah-led opposition reached a deal last week aimed at ending an 18-month political crisis that pushed the country to the brink of civil war , and paved the way for sleiman 's election . the agreement , reached in doha , qatar , calls for a consensus government in which the cabinet would be comprised of 30 posts -- 16 for the majority , 11 for the hezbollah-led opposition and three set aside for the president to nominate . the seat allocation had been a key sticking point for the opposition , which wanted to ensure it had the power to veto major decisions . with 11 cabinet posts , it will have that power . in exchange for the veto power and a redistricting plan ahead of next year 's elections , hezbollah agreed to end its sit-in protest that has paralyzed downtown beirut since late 2006 . in his speech , sleiman expressed gratitude to qatar and to the arab league for helping broker the deal . sleiman was the consensus candidate , and is viewed as a neutral party by lebanon 's political factions . the nation 's previous presidents have been seen as either pro-syrian or pro-western . in his 10 years as chief of the army , sleiman also is believed to have unified the splintered military . however , he inherits a nation grappling with divisions . lebanon 's elected , pro-western government has long been locked in a power struggle with hezbollah . in public statements and demonstrations in recent years , hezbollah threatened to use its power and popularity to oust the sunni-led government , triggering fears of a new civil war that could further destabilize the volatile region . the election helped end a political crisis that deteriorated into violence this month . that crisis was defused when the lebanese government gave in to two key hezbollah demands -- lifting a government ban of hezbollah 's telecommunications system and reinstating the chief of security at beirut 's airport . `` the performance of the opposition proved that it did not organize a coup , but only wanted the illegal government to withdraw its two decisions , '' nasrallah said . `` i promise that the opposition 's representation in the government will not be monopolized by hezbollah , amal and the change and reform bloc . we will give other opposition parties shares - and unfortunately we must speak of shares - even if it is at the expense of hezbollah 's shares . '' hezbollah has been linked to numerous terrorist attacks against u.s. , israeli , and other western targets and the united states lists it as a terrorist organization . but many in lebanon and other parts of the middle east -- particularly shiites -- view hezbollah militants as freedom fighters .

972	-lrb- aol autos -rrb- -- there is an old adage which goes something like this : `` the cheap man always pays more in the long run . '' consumer reports analyzed the cost of ownership across the 300 models in their database . consumer reports magazine recently reached a similar conclusion when it announced the results of a study that compared the cost of ownership of more than 300 cars . consumer reports noted that a car with a cheaper sticker price can often cost consumers more in the long run when compared to a higher-priced alternative . the report , which appeared in consumer reports ' annual april auto issue , was based on a comparison of the 300 models in the consumer reports database . in short , the report concluded that a car 's sticker price is one of many factors that should be taken into account when trying to decide between two cars in the same class . for example , at about $ 17,500 , a mitsubishi lancer is priced $ 5,000 less than a mini cooper . but when factoring in the total costs of ownership for each vehicle , the lancer could cost drivers about $ 3,000 more to own over the first five years , according to the study . and the purchase price of a toyota highlander is about $ 3,000 more than a v6 ford explorer -- but the explorer 's total cost of ownership is an extra $ 6,500 over those five years . the study took into account such factors as depreciation , fuel costs , interest paid on the car loan , insurance , maintenance , repair costs and sales tax . online subscribers to www.consumerreports.org can compare the costs for one , three , five and eight years of ownership . `` we think this information is valuable for consumers who have shopped around , and settled on a couple of different cars they like , and then have to decide on one or the other , '' noted cliff weathers , consumer reports ' deputy editor , autos . `` we 're giving this information to the consumer to use as a tool to help them make that decision , a tie-breaker , if you will . `` if they 're trying to decide between a pontiac solstice and mazda miata , for example , they can go to our web site and find out which one will cost less to own over that five-year period . and in this particular case , the answer would be the miata -- which was one of the least expensive cars to own of all the cars evaluated in our survey . '' depreciation was factored into the estimates based on the assumption that the vehicle will eventually be traded in when buyers make their next car purchase . `` depreciation is the factor that accounts for the highest cost of ownership , '' weathers explained . `` depreciation accounts for 48 percent of the cost of ownership over the first five years . '' different models depreciate faster , and more significantly , than others . in order to calculate depreciation for this owner-cost comparison , consumer reports started with the price that a typically-equipped model generally sells for . if a particular model often sells at a largely-discounted price that was also factored in . consumer reports then deducted the wholesale trade-in value of the car at the end of the period , based on data from their used car price service , weathers explained . in those cases when consumer reports did n't have depreciation data for a new model , it used estimates based on comparable vehicles . the fuel factor . the second-biggest factor in cost-of-ownership , after depreciation , is fuel costs , which account for 21 percent of the total ownership costs . `` fuel economy can really make a big difference , '' weathers said . `` if you have a car that gets 25 miles per gallon , and another car that gets 19 miles per gallon , that 's a potential difference of thousands of dollars over five years , if you 're driving 12,000 miles a year . '' consumer reports calculated fuel costs by assuming that the vehicles would be driven 12,000 miles a year -- the average annual mileage reported by those who responded to consumer reports ' annual reader survey . consumer reports then applied the national average price of regular gas as of december 2007 or , if applicable , the price of premium or diesel fuel . fuel costs were an especially big factor with suvs , the comparison revealed . drivers who buy a dodge nitro could pay more than $ 10,000 to fill up the tank over a five-year period , for example . but the fuel costs for a similar-sized , more fuel-efficient toyota rav4 v6 would be $ 2,000 less during that period . consumer reports ' comparison also concluded that interest paid on car loans accounts for about 12 percent of five-year ownership costs . that figure is based on a five-year loan , with a 15 percent down payment , using the average interest rate of 6.86 percent reported by bankrate.com in december 2007 . auto insurance accounts for about 11 percent of total ownership costs over five years , according to the consumer reports comparison . car insurance costs can vary depending on several factors such as the driver 's age , location , and driving record . auto insurance costs , in some cases , dramatically boosted the ownership costs of models that otherwise boasted reasonable ownership costs . as an example , weathers compared the difference in auto insurance rates for mitsubishi lancer evolution and a similarly-priced acura tl . `` insurance for the lancer can cost you $ 2,500 a year or more , based our 2007 figures , '' notes weathers . `` meanwhile , the annual car insurance rates for the acura tl can cost as little as $ 900 . '' maintenance & repairs . surprisingly , maintenance and car repairs account for only four percent of the cost of ownership , weathers said . the maintenance and repair cost figures used in consumer reports ' cost of ownership comparison were based on information gleaned from more than a million respondents in its annual car reliability survey . one notable conclusion reached in the consumer reports study is that lexus models have relatively high maintenance and repair costs -- primarily due to maintenance alone , even though lexus owners reported excellent reliability . the lexus es350 racks up an average of $ 2,300 in maintenance and repair in the first five years . meanwhile , owners of a comparable lincoln mkz can expect to pay only half that much . another interesting tidbit discovered in the comparison is that the range rover is the most expensive vehicle on average for five and eight years when it comes to maintenance and repairs , costing about $ 2,000 in the fifth year alone . meanwhile , the comparable toyota land cruiser costs only $ 600 in that year to maintain and repair . some might be surprised to hear that the sales tax on the purchase price of the vehicle accounts for as much of the cost of ownership as maintenance and repairs . for its study , consumer reports used the national average of 4.83 percent in 2007 . with hybrid cars being a hot topic in the auto industry , consumer reports was also interested in the cost of owning one of those fuel-sipping vehicles . the report concluded that toyota prius hybrid actually costs less to own than similar conventional models . specifically , the sale price of a prius is about $ 7,500 higher than a similarly-sized chevrolet cobalt , but the total cost of ownership over five years is almost $ 2,000 less - due primarily to its much lower fuel costs , although the amount of depreciation was a factor as well . weathers pointed to another interesting finding : `` there are some vehicles , namely bmw , that are very inexpensive to own over first five years , because all of the maintenance is paid for during that period , under the warranty , '' he says . `` but if we take it forward , the cost of maintenance and repairs over the next three years after that is going to be more expensive .

975	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- human rights and freedom of the press in china , the detention of terrorist suspects by the united states and russia 's treatment of political dissent are the focus of scrutiny in amnesty international 's annual report , released wednesday , which looks at the state of human rights around the world . amnesty international protestors outside the us supreme court in january dressed as guantanamo bay detainees . the 398-page report comes 60 years after the united nations adopted the universal declaration of human rights , and amnesty says governments still need to act on their promises . `` the biggest threat to the future of human rights is the absence of a shared vision and collective leadership , '' the organization said in a statement . irene khan , amnesty 's secretary-general , said that in particular , `` the human-rights flash points in darfur , zimbabwe , gaza , iraq and myanmar demand immediate attention . '' the report , the group said , `` reveals a world riven by inequality , scarred by discrimination and distorted by political repression . '' according to its count , people are tortured or subject to other ill treatment in at least 81 countries , face unfair trials in at least 54 countries and are not allowed to express themselves freely in at least 77 countries . of the 150 countries and regions listed in the report , amnesty paid particular attention to china , the host of this summer 's olympic games . the group said growing numbers of human rights activists were imprisoned or harassed in china in 2007 , with ethnic and religious minorities -- including tibetans , falun gong practitioners and christians -- repressed or persecuted . death penalty statistics in china are difficult to assess , amnesty said , but based on public reports , the group estimated that at least 470 people were executed in 2007 . amnesty also noted the repression of free speech in china and said censorship of the internet and other media intensified last year . `` the chinese authorities maintained efforts to tightly control the flow of information , '' the report said . `` they decided what topics and news stories could be published , and media outlets were sometimes required to respond within minutes to government directives . the authorities continued to block web sites and to filter internet content based on specified words and topics . '' around 30 journalists and at least 50 others are known to be in prison for posting their views online , amnesty said . amnesty also criticized the death penalty in the united states , where 42 people were executed last year . it noted new jersey 's decision in december to abolish the death penalty made it the first u.s. state in more than 40 years to do away with executions . as it has in previous annual reports , amnesty criticized the detention of hundreds of foreign nationals at the u.s. naval base at guantanamo bay , cuba . `` the usa must close guantanamo detention camp and secret detention centers , prosecute the detainees under fair trial standards or release them , and unequivocally reject the use of torture and ill-treatment , '' amnesty said . the group noted that guantanamo detainees are held indefinitely , most of them without charge and without recourse to u.s. courts . most detainees there are held in isolation in maximum-security facilities , heightening concerns for their physical and mental health , amnesty said . in fact , more is written on the united states than any other country listed in the report . asked about that at a press conference tuesday , khan said , `` we certainly devote a lot of time to sudan , to china , to zimbabwe and other countries . but we look to the u.s. to provide leadership around the world . governments around the world look to the united states as a role model for their own behavior . '' in a lengthy section on iraq , amnesty noted that thousands of civilians , including children , were killed or injured in ongoing sectarian violence during 2007 . `` all sides involved in the fighting committed gross human rights violations , some of which amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity , '' the report said . abductions , torture and murder , with bodies left in the street , occur daily , and the violence has caused 2 million iraqis to flee to syria , jordan and elsewhere , amnesty said . u.s. forces held some 25,000 detainees `` without charge or trial , '' the group said , and 33 people were executed , `` some after grossly unfair trials . '' in afghanistan , conflict and insecurity aggravated by drought and floods contributed to `` large-scale displacement '' of people throughout the year . `` at least 6,500 people were estimated to have been killed in the context of the conflict , '' the report said . `` violations of international humanitarian and human rights law were committed with impunity by all parties , including afghan and international security forces and insurgent groups . '' russia must show greater tolerance for political dissent , amnesty said . `` the russian authorities were increasingly intolerant of dissent or criticism , branding it ` unpatriotic , ' '' the report said . `` a crackdown on civil and political rights was evident throughout the year and in particular during the run-up to the state duma -lsb- parliament -rsb- elections in december . '' the european court of human rights ruled that russia was responsible for enforced disappearances , torture and extrajudicial executions in 15 judgments relating to the recent conflict in chechnya , amnesty said . there were fewer reported disappearances in the chechen republic in 2007 than in previous years , amnesty said , but continued human rights violations made people reluctant to report abuses . the report also criticized human rights conditions in iran , gaza and myanmar . human rights conditions in zimbabwe continued to decline in 2007 , the report said , `` with an increase in organized violence and torture and restrictions on the rights to freedom of association , assembly and expression .

'' clinton and top aides were sharply critical of rival democrat barack obama in february when reports indicated that his top economic adviser had suggested to a canadian official that obama was not as supportive of changes to the north american free trade agreement as the illinois senator claimed to be on the campaign trail . penn said friday that clinton 's opposition to the u.s.-colombia pact , which the bush administration is trying to push through congress , `` is clear and was not discussed '' during his meeting with the ambassador . and clinton spokesman mo elleithee said penn 's meeting was `` not in any way done on behalf of the campaign .

982	middlesbrough , england -- middlesbrough have confirmed that midfielders fabio rochemback and gaizka mendieta and striker dong gook lee have all been released . middlesbrough have decided against taking up the option of re-signing brazilian midfielder fabio rochemback . the premier league club had an option to extend brazilian rochemback 's deal by another two years , but manager gareth southgate has decided to let him go . `` we both feel that the time is right for fabio to have a fresh challenge , '' southgate said . `` he is a talented footballer and i think he 's just had his best season for us , while it was fitting that he should bow out against manchester city on sunday with probably his best performance in a middlesbrough shirt . '' the 26-year-old joined boro from barcelona in 2005 and played 91 games for the teesside club . he signed off in style by scoring a thumping long-range free-kick in sunday 's 8-1 victory over city . rochemback , who netted seven times for boro , played a major role in helping the club reach the 2006 uefa cup final , a year after appearing in the final during a loan spell with sporting lisbon -- where he is expected to move back to this summer . mendieta , 34 , was one of football 's costliest players when he joined lazio from valencia for 48 million euros in 2001 , but he disappointed and joined barcelona and then boro on loan . the former spain midfielder joined permanently on a free transfer in 2004 , but has not played for the first team since december 26 , 2006 . `` it was a difficult situation for a player of gaizka 's caliber to find himself out of the first team reckoning , '' added southgate . `` i made it clear to him that he did not figure in my plans but he decided to stay and try to get back into the first team . `` that did n't work out but his attitude to training was always excellent and he was a good influence on some of our young reserve team players . '' south korean international lee joined boro on a free transfer from pohang steelers in january 2007 . he scored only twice in 11 starts and 18 appearances as a substitute and has not appeared for the first team since early february . southgate is still hopeful of persuading goalkeeper mark schwarzer to sign a new contract at the riverside . the 35-year-old australian joined boro from bradford city in a $ 3 million deal in february 1997 and has played nearly 450 games for the club . his deal runs out this summer and he has so far refused to sign an extension , prompting reports of interest from a host of european clubs . `` we are talking to mark . i 'd like him to stay . his experience is important but he has real drive and determination that is still increasing , '' said southgate . `` he is the one in our dressing room that can truly say he has played at the highest level -- in world cups , in europe , in cup finals and so on . `` we have to negotiate and see where we go , but players have to want to stay here and we have to want to keep them . `` mark has been here a long time so he has to decide if he needs a fresh challenge , whether what we are trying to do is going to excite him , whether he feels he is going to be appreciated here . '' southgate also confirmed they have offered striker tom craddock and right-back tony mcmahon one-year extensions to their current deals , which run out this summer . brazilian rivaldo has changed his mind about retiring and says he will play for greek club aek again next season . the 36-year-old had decided to quit after aek were denied the title because olympiakos were awarded three points for a game they lost after the opposing team fielded an ineligible player . `` the truth is that at the end of the championship , i felt great disappointment and a -lrb- sense of -rrb- injustice , but the love and support i have received from fans and the team have contributed to my final decision ... i have decided to stay at aek next season , '' rivaldo said in a statement on the club 's web site . olympiakos lost 1-0 on february 3 , but greek sports authorities gave them the points because apollon played roman wallner who had turned out for two other clubs during the season . apollon 's appeal to the court of arbitration for sport was rejected on april 21 . olympiakos finished the season with 70 points , two ahead of aek , for their 11th title in 12 years . rivaldo , who has played at ac milan and barcelona and starred in brazil 's 2002 world cup victory , spent three seasons at olympiakos from 2004 . he moved to aek last year after a contract dispute . tottenham midfielder jamie o'hara has signed a new three-year contract with the club . the 21-year-old made his debut this season and went on to score two goals in a total 25 appearances . `` he has come a long way in a short space of time so i congratulate him and this new contract is recognition of his efforts , '' said manager juande ramos . `` jamie is an example to all the young players at the club in that reaching the first team can be achieved through hard work and giving the best of yourself . '' however , tottenham goalkeeper radek cerny has left the club . the 34-year-old czech international , who was on loan from sparta prague , has joined ambitious championship club queens park rangers on a two-year contract .
983	douglas , arizona -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it 's a tale of homeland security concerns blocking wildlife management , and the hue and cry that ensues . this photo , taken by warner glenn in 1996 , is believed to be the first of a live jaguar in the united states . when most people think of jaguars , they think of the jungles of central and south america , not the remote desert ranges between the united states and mexico . that region is known as mountain lion country , and that 's what rancher warner glenn thought he was tracking when he saddled up his mules on a summer day 12 years ago near douglas , arizona . glenn has hunted mountain lions for 60 years , since he was eight years old . but glenn was stunned when he saw what his hunting dogs had chased up to a high mountain perch . the rancher took what 's believed to be the first photo of a live jaguar in the united states . but it was n't his last . in 2006 , some 40 miles away , glenn and his hunting party again cornered a jaguar -- a different one . jaguars , an endangered species , have a breeding population in northern mexico . scientists believe there are no more than 120 left in the wild there . it 's believed that since 1910 , the cats are only visitors north of the border . they have been virtually unstudied here until recently . but glenn and other conservationists worry that the possible return of breeding jaguars to the united states could be stopped in its tracks . the reason : the border fence . last month the department of homeland security waived 30 environmental laws to finish 470 miles of the fence by the end of the year . homeland security secretary michael chertoff told congress that the agency continues to talk to some 600 landowners along the border to get their input . but in order to comply with the congressional mandate , he said , there is no time to deal with `` unnecessary delays caused by administrative processes or potential litigation . '' `` we are currently in a lawless situation at the border , '' says chertoff . `` i feel an urgency to get this tactical infrastructure in . and although we 're going to be respectful of the environment , we 're going to be expeditious . '' two environmental groups , defenders of wildlife and the sierra club , have filed appeals with the u.s. supreme court , claiming the waivers are unconstitutional and set a dangerous precedent . `` national security and environmental protection do not have to be at odds with each other , '' says defenders of wildlife spokesman matt clark . `` if we can drop this arbitrary deadline for constructing the fence and go through the proper procedures , then there are inevitably ways to minimize environmental impact , but as it is now it 's throwing all of those laws out the window . '' mountain lion tracker jack childs also worries about the impact of the fence on local wildlife , especially the jaguar . childs captured the first video of a live jaguar in the late summer of 1996 , a few months after warner glenn . watch childs and glenn talk about efforts to preserve the jaguar '' `` i knew historically there had been a few jaguars sighted in arizona but in the last hundred years never in any numbers . '' his encounter sparked a passion for the big cats . along with wife anna and biologist emil mccain , he created the borderlands jaguar detection project . see images of the controversy '' childs and mccain hike into remote mountain areas where the jaguars roam and have placed more than 50 motion sensor cameras near the border . they 've taken 69 photos of three different jaguars since 2001 , including several of the same cat childs first saw in 1996 . he has nicknamed that cat macho b . a jaguar 's spots are like fingerprints -- each cat has a unique set . one of the spots on macho b resembles a pinocchio cartoon figure , and that 's how they identify him . `` we spend a lot of time walking along the border during the daytime , and we actually find his tracks going through the fence , so we know for sure that he crosses back and forth , '' says childs . `` a fence like that is going to inhibit wildlife movements and migrations back and forth . it 's not going to effectively stop human traffic . they 've got wire cutters and torches . '' see where the jaguars have been spotted '' childs says the fence also has an impact on wildlife because drug runners and human traffickers have been pushed up into the mountain areas to avoid the fence in the lowland valleys . `` it 's impacting the animals number one , what 's going on down there . it 's almost brought my wildlife study to a stop because they -lrb- the traffickers -rrb- are tearing down my cameras as fast as i 'm putting them up because they think we 're taking pictures of them . '' the u.s. fish and wildlife service finds itself in a unique position . its mission is wildlife and habitat protection , but it must uphold another federal agency 's mission to override environmental concerns . bill radke , manager of the san bernardino wildlife refuge , says the border patrol is trying to work with his agency . `` the hope is that by working with border patrol that we can meet the national security mandate and at the same time protect the wildlife , '' says radke . `` border patrol is putting up camera towers but are putting them up on areas that are off the refuge . they 're working on barriers but not barriers that would impede wildlife and large animals like jaguars . '' at 6 foot 6 , with steely blue eyes , dressed in leather chaps astride his mule , rancher warner glenn is every inch the american cowboy . and he is a man forever changed by his encounters with the jaguar . he has written a book , `` eyes of fire , '' about his experience . he says he 'd like to `` invite mr. bush to come out on a mule '' so he can see `` what 's going on here in these mountains . '' for glenn , the cat represents all that is wild about the southwest . `` it would be a loss to me that maybe my granddaughter or my daughter would n't be able to see one like i have . it 's just an animal that 's a beautiful , magnificent cat and they 're having a little bit of trouble surviving . but they 're doing it , and i would hate to see us do anything that would cause the survival of that cat to go backwards . `` i 'm a livestock rancher , but i would n't mind donating a few calves to that jaguar , so to speak . '' biologist emil mccain agrees . `` they are part of our natural heritage . they are part of the american west . they are part of the american wild as much as the bald eagle or the grizzly bear , and the jaguar is really special because it is such an elusive and beautiful creature -lsb- that -rsb- it evokes a sense of imagination and curiosity about the natural world .

987	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.s. government has charged an international arms dealer with conspiring to sell a rebel group millions of dollars in weapons `` to be used to kill americans in colombia , '' federal prosecutors announced tuesday . viktor bout is accused of selling missiles , rockets and other weapons to farc , a colombian rebel group . viktor bout , who was recently captured in thailand , had agreed to sell the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- surface-to-air missiles , armor-piercing rocket launchers , `` ultralight '' airplanes , unmanned aerial vehicles , and other weapons , the u.s. department of justice said in a news release . there was no immediate public response from bout , who remains in custody in thailand . federal authorities unsealed an indictment charging bout with four terrorism offenses : conspiracy to kill u.s. nationals , conspiracy to kill u.s. officers or employees , conspiracy to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile , and conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization . farc is designated a terrorist organization by the u.s. state department . justice department officials said they are seeking bout 's extradition to the united states . the indictment alleges that bout made agreements with farc between november 2007 and march of this year . in their news release , federal prosecutors said bout agreed to sell weapons `` to two confidential sources '' working with the u.s. drug enforcement administration , who had `` represented that they were acquiring these weapons for the farc , with the specific understanding that the weapons were to be used to attack united states helicopters in colombia . '' the news release also refers to a `` covertly recorded meeting in thailand on march 6 , 2008 . '' `` with the unsealing of this indictment , we are one step closer to ensuring bout has delivered his last load of high-powered weaponry and armed his final terrorist , '' dea acting administrator michele m. loenhart said in the news release . attorney general michael mukasey last month singled out bout as a leading example of a new breed of organized crime leaders who operate across international boundaries to amass wealth without regard to political ideology . `` viktor bout has long been considered by the international community as one of the world 's most prolific arms traffickers , '' u.s. attorney michael garcia said in the news release tuesday . bout 's assets in the united states were frozen in 2004 after he allegedly shipped weapons to liberia in violation of u.s. government restrictions .
988	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- in `` street kings , '' keanu reeves ' bad-boy cop tom ludlow may not play by the rules , but the film sure does . keanu reeves , second from left , and forest whitaker are shifty cops in `` street kings . '' the movie is textbook cop noir . directed by david ayer , who wrote `` training day '' and directed `` harsh times , '' from a script that originated with `` l.a. confidential '' novelist james ellroy , it 's a story both men have told before and will doubtless return to again . too bad that story -- the one about the constant struggle with an impure world , betrayal , disillusionment , retribution , all that jazz -- is n't told with much originality this time around . as ludlow , a detective with a special lapd vice squad , reeves shoots first and asks questions much , much later . in his field the bad guys are easy to spot , and if tom has to get his hands dirty , well , then he 'll be careful to wipe away the residue before he calls it in . he works from the gut . we have ludlow 's number from the beginning : he wakes up , vomits , cleans his gun , and knocks back a couple of miniature bottles of vodka . then he crashes a kidnappers ' den and puts down four gangsters before they know what 's hit them . `` do n't worry , '' he tells the distraught little girls caged up in the back . `` i 'm a cop . '' it 's probably superfluous to add that he 's still nursing a grievous hangover from the wife who died in flagrante with a person unknown two or three years ago . it 's also probably superfluous to mention that internal affairs -lrb- headed by hugh laurie -rrb- is beginning to sniff around ludlow 's unit . in particular , ia is talking to his ex-partner washington -lrb- terry crews -rrb- , a revelation that sends ludlow reaching for his baseball bat . before he can put washington straight , though , his old pal is gunned down before his eyes by a couple of punks . can ludlow cover up his own potentially incriminating presence at the scene and still track down the cop killers ? hell , yes , even if he has to alienate everyone in the department before he 's through . reeves does n't do much `` acting '' as such , but he does n't need to : his performance is clean and spare , in synch with ayer 's clipped economy , and he has a doleful quality that goes some way to redeem a nasty and wretchedly naïve character . alcoholism does n't appear to have thrown off ludlow 's aim any , but it must have dulled his reasoning . a broody , intuitive detective should be able to piece together this boilerplate mystery without too much head-scratching , but ludlow never stops to look even two steps ahead . -lrb- i guess he 's not a james ellroy fan . -rrb- . but what he lacks in insight he makes up for in sheer determination , not to say blood-lust . in a neat touch , when it 's time to cool off his public profile for a spell , the rogue cop is transferred to a desk in the complaints department -- surely his idea of purgatory , and , obviously , an utterly pointless occupation . forest whitaker boosts the energy level as ludlow 's paternalistic mentor , boss , and no. 1 fan : `` you 're the tip of the spear , '' he tells him . `` who else is going to hold back the animals ? '' violent and cynical and a shade or two overdetermined , `` street kings '' ably demonstrates the pitfalls embedded in the pragmatics of `` a necessary evil , '' or anyone who sets himself up as a law unto himself , but ultimately it ca n't conceive of a better alternative . after all , the rest is politics , a game that even the most hard-boiled anti-hero would never lower himself to enter . and , besides , he 's seen it before . `` street kings '' is rated r and runs 107 minutes . for entertainment weekly 's take , click here . e-mail to a friend .

'' one of the stated goals of the pope 's visit is to energize the u.s. catholic community , which has an estimated 70 million members . three years after succeeding pope john paul ii , benedict is likely to address the sex scandal within the catholic church , the church 's relationship with other faiths , the u.s.-led war in iraq and the upcoming u.s. presidential election , said john allen , a cnn vatican analyst . the fallout from the sex scandal has had a serious impact on the u.s. catholic church in terms of its finances , its moral authority and the demoralization of catholics . during the flight from rome to washington , the pope told reporters aboard that he was ashamed of the problem . watch the pope express his shame about the scandal '' ` intense ' security . meanwhile , security preparations were under way in the air , on land and in the water . twenty-seven state , local and federal agencies will protect the pope as he meets with religious leaders , celebrates mass at a baseball stadium and makes his way around the capital in his distinctive `` popemobile . '' there are no specific threats against benedict , according to the fbi , but a march audio message from osama bin laden mentioned the pontiff . the centerpiece of the washington leg of the u.s. visit will be thursday 's mass at nationals park , a new baseball stadium where 46,000 people will gather to watch the pope . everyone will go through metal detectors on their way in , and nearby roads and bridges will be closed . temporary flight restrictions will be in place over the stadium . watch how washington is preparing for papal visit '' a 1 1/2 - mile section of the adjacent anacostia river will be closed during the mass. . the coast guard will patrol the river in boats with machine guns mounted on their bows . `` i am worried about a terrorist attack , '' said lt. lynda lecrone of the coast guard . `` we are here to detect , deter and defend against waterborne attack on this highly publicized event . ... we can use force .

'' he said boys usually have some focus and a concrete goal when they fight . `` but girls want to cause pain and make the other girl feel bad , '' he said . judd , the polk county sheriff , said an important part of the plan in the lakeland attack was to post the video of the beating on youtube to humiliate and embarrass the victim . `` it 's the next stage of cyberbullying , '' psychologist susan lipkins said . `` they want to show what they 're doing . '' `` our kids are being peer pressured , in another sense of a trend , to put these shock videos out there at other peoples ' expense , '' said talisa lindsay , the victim 's mother . `` and i hope that it does n't come to the point where there 's more people 's lives that are being affected by having to take a beating for entertainment , or possibly being killed . '' watch mother describe how the victim is doing '' the suspects did n't have a chance to post the video online before police moved in and seized it , judd said . the sheriff 's department made it public , and it wound up on youtube anyway . judd recognizes the irony . `` in a perverted sense , we were feeding into exactly what the kids wanted , '' he said . `` but according to florida law , -lsb- the video -rsb- is public record , and it 's going to be in the public domain whether we agree with that or not .

994	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- georgian leaders may be blaming russia for the conflict raging in south ossetia , but former soviet president mikhail gorbachev said thursday `` there is no doubt '' that georgia provoked the clash . mikhail gorbachev told cnn 's larry king that russia called extra troops into georgia to stem violence . gorbachev told cnn 's larry king that russia moved additional forces into south ossetia in response to `` devastation '' in the south ossetia city of tskhinvali . `` this was the use of sophisticated weapons against a small town , against a sleeping people . this was a barbaric assault , '' said gorbachev , the last president of the former soviet union . but georgian president mikheil saakashvili , who also appeared on cnn 's `` larry king live '' thursday , said he was `` profoundly shocked '' that mikhail gorbachev would use a television appearance `` for basically vindicating lies and deceptions . '' last week , georgia said it launched an operation into south ossetia after a cease-fire was broken with artillery fire from russian separatists that killed 10 people including civilians and peacekeepers . it accused russia , which also has peacekeepers in the region , of backing the separatists . hours later , the russian news agency interfax reported that russian authorities said 10 russian peacekeepers had been killed and 30 wounded in an attack by georgians . `` western television did n't show what happened in tskhinvali , '' gorbachev said . `` only now they 're beginning to show some pictures of the destruction . so this looks to me like it was a well-prepared project . and with any outcome , they wanted to put the blame on russia . '' watch gorbachev discuss `` barbaric assault '' '' he called georgia 's claims that russia is attempting to dismantle its democracy `` all lies from beginning to end . '' in response , saakashvili expressed disappointment with the sentiments from gorbachev , who he said he once respected . `` this is the man , mr. gorbachev , who helped to , you know , bring down kgb kingdom . and he is the one who is , you know , justifying what the kgb people are doing right now in my country , '' saakashvili said . `` shame on him . shame on you , mr. gorbachev , for perpetuating the very regime you helped to defeat and you fought against as the head of the soviet union . '' gorbachev also said the united states is jeopardizing its fragile relationship with russia by backing georgia . watch gorbachev discuss u.s.-russia relations '' `` there is a chance for our two countries to develop a new agenda for cooperation so as to promote both u.s. and russia interests , and the interests of other countries , and the interests of stability , particularly in the hotspots in different continents , '' said gorbachev , who won the nobel peace price in 1990 .
995	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the united states believes that some members of pakistan 's spy service provided support for the deadly bombing last month of india 's embassy in afghanistan , a u.s. counterterrorism official told cnn friday . the indian embassy in kabul was badly damaged in the july 7 bombing . pakistan strongly denied the allegation friday , but afghanistan and india have previously accused pakistan of involvement in the attack which killed 58 people including an indian defense attache . the official told cnn the evidence was not strong enough to draw a firm conclusion but there is a `` strong suspicion '' the taliban was behind the attack , and that some unspecified aid came from pakistan 's directorate of inter-services intelligence , or isi . the official would not say how the intelligence was gathered , but he said the evidence was presented to senior pakistani officials by a top cia official , deputy director stephen kappes . the new york times , sourcing u.s. government officials , reported friday that the united states intercepted communications between pakistani intelligence officers and militants who carried out the attack in kabul . pakistani maj. gen. athar abbas said the report `` unfounded and malicious '' and an `` effort to malign the isi , '' -- pakistan 's directorate of inter-services intelligence . the bombing killed 58 people . `` the isi is a very disciplined organization , manned by military officials . it has played the most crucial role in the war on terror and apprehended members of al qaeda , the taliban , and those linked to the attack on mainland america on 9/11 , '' abbas said . abbas said `` despite our insistence , no evidence has been provided to us about these allegations . '' afghanistan claims pakistan informally supports militants operating from havens in pakistan 's lawless tribal regions near the porous 1,500-mile border the two countries share . earlier this month , afghan lawmakers directly accused pakistan 's isi in connection with a string of attacks in afghanistan . among these were the kabul strike and an assassination attempt on afghan president hamid karzai at an april 27 military ceremony . a senior afghan government official said the charges were based on phone intercepts of conversations of plotters in kabul with isi officers in pakistan . a u.s. government official , who would not comment on the specifics of the new york times story , said , `` we 've long noted the troubling reports of a relationship between the isi and the taliban , and the incident at the indian embassy seems to fit the pattern of those reports . '' india has previously blamed militants from pakistan for the july 7 car bombing at the embassy . wajid shamsul hasan , pakistan 's high commissioner to britain , and hamid gul , former head of the isi , firmly denied the agency 's involvement in the attack . watch pakistan deny the allegations '' `` there seems to be a bit of sensationalism in this story , '' hasan said . he said the government has regularly denied claims that isi is involved with militants in afghanistan and noted that pakistan has been cooperating in the fight against terrorism . gul said the claims are `` preposterous '' and `` totally false , '' and cautioned that the cia has been proven to be wrong about intelligence in the past . the new york times report also sourced the u.s. officials as saying `` there was new information showing that members of the pakistani intelligence service were increasingly providing militants with details about the american campaign against them , in some cases allowing militants to avoid american missile strikes in pakistan 's tribal areas . '' pakistan and afghanistan have a tumultuous past . during the soviet occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , religious schools in pakistan helped train fighters who battled the soviets . after the taliban took over afghanistan in 1996 and imposed fundamentalist rule , pakistan was one of the few countries that recognized the regime diplomatically . it dropped its support after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on washington and new york . pakistan also has a troubled history with india , and in the past india has accused the isi of supporting militant separatists in indian-administered kashmir , which has been the root of two wars between them .
