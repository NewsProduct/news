0	editor 's note : in our behind the scenes series , cnn correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events . here , soledad o'brien takes users inside a jail where many of the inmates are mentally ill . an inmate housed on the `` forgotten floor , '' where many mentally ill inmates are housed in miami before trial . miami , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the ninth floor of the miami-dade pretrial detention facility is dubbed the `` forgotten floor . '' here , inmates with the most severe mental illnesses are incarcerated until they 're ready to appear in court . most often , they face drug charges or charges of assaulting an officer -- charges that judge steven leifman says are usually `` avoidable felonies . '' he says the arrests often result from confrontations with police . mentally ill people often wo n't do what they 're told when police arrive on the scene -- confrontation seems to exacerbate their illness and they become more paranoid , delusional , and less likely to follow directions , according to leifman . so , they end up on the ninth floor severely mentally disturbed , but not getting any real help because they 're in jail . we toured the jail with leifman . he is well known in miami as an advocate for justice and the mentally ill . even though we were not exactly welcomed with open arms by the guards , we were given permission to shoot videotape and tour the floor . go inside the ` forgotten floor ' '' at first , it 's hard to determine where the people are . the prisoners are wearing sleeveless robes . imagine cutting holes for arms and feet in a heavy wool sleeping bag -- that 's kind of what they look like . they 're designed to keep the mentally ill patients from injuring themselves . that 's also why they have no shoes , laces or mattresses . leifman says about one-third of all people in miami-dade county jails are mentally ill . so , he says , the sheer volume is overwhelming the system , and the result is what we see on the ninth floor . of course , it is a jail , so it 's not supposed to be warm and comforting , but the lights glare , the cells are tiny and it 's loud . we see two , sometimes three men -- sometimes in the robes , sometimes naked , lying or sitting in their cells . `` i am the son of the president . you need to get me out of here ! '' one man shouts at me . he is absolutely serious , convinced that help is on the way -- if only he could reach the white house . leifman tells me that these prisoner-patients will often circulate through the system , occasionally stabilizing in a mental hospital , only to return to jail to face their charges . it 's brutally unjust , in his mind , and he has become a strong advocate for changing things in miami . over a meal later , we talk about how things got this way for mental patients . leifman says 200 years ago people were considered `` lunatics '' and they were locked up in jails even if they had no charges against them . they were just considered unfit to be in society . over the years , he says , there was some public outcry , and the mentally ill were moved out of jails and into hospitals . but leifman says many of these mental hospitals were so horrible they were shut down . where did the patients go ? nowhere . the streets . they became , in many cases , the homeless , he says . they never got treatment . leifman says in 1955 there were more than half a million people in state mental hospitals , and today that number has been reduced 90 percent , and 40,000 to 50,000 people are in mental hospitals . the judge says he 's working to change this . starting in 2008 , many inmates who would otherwise have been brought to the `` forgotten floor '' will instead be sent to a new mental health facility -- the first step on a journey toward long-term treatment , not just punishment . leifman says it 's not the complete answer , but it 's a start . leifman says the best part is that it 's a win-win solution . the patients win , the families are relieved , and the state saves money by simply not cycling these prisoners through again and again . and , for leifman , justice is served . e-mail to a friend .

'' like his wife , he could n't stop smiling . he talked about how he tried in vain to get help for his son in baghdad , leaving `` no stone unturned '' on a mission to help his boy . there were many trips to the ministry of health . he says he even put in a request to iraq 's parliament for help . the family eventually told cnn their story -- that youssif was grabbed by masked men outside their home on january 15 , doused in gasoline and set on fire . simply by coming forward , his parents put themselves in incredible danger . no one has been arrested or held accountable in youssif 's case . watch cnn 's arwa damon describe ` truly phenomenal ' outpouring '' shortly after youssif 's story aired wednesday , the children 's burn foundation -- a nonprofit organization based in sherman oaks , california , that provides support for burn victims locally , nationally and internationally -- agreed to pay for the transportation for youssif and his family to come to the united states and to set up a fund for donations . you can make a donation at the foundation 's site by clicking here . there 's a drop-down menu under the `` general donation '' area that is marked `` youssif 's fund .

'' youssif 's parents said they know it 's going to be a lengthy and difficult process and that adjusting to their stay in america may not be easy . but none of that matters -- getting help for their boy is first and foremost . `` i will do anything for youssif , '' his father said , pulling his son closer to him . `` our child is everything . '' his mother tried to coax youssif to talk to us on this day . but he did n't want to ; his mother says he 's shy outside of their home . the biggest obstacle now is getting the visas to leave , and the serious security risks they face every day and hour they remain in iraq . but this family -- which saw the very worst in humanity on that january day -- has new hope in the world . that is partly due to the tens of thousands of cnn.com users who were so moved by the story and wanted to act . cnn iraqi staff central to bringing this story together were also overwhelmed with the generosity coming from people outside of their border . in a nation that largely feels abandoned by the rest of the world , it was a refreshing realization . e-mail to a friend . cnn.com senior producer wayne drash contributed to this report in atlanta .
4	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- doctors removed five small polyps from president bush 's colon on saturday , and `` none appeared worrisome , '' a white house spokesman said . the polyps were removed and sent to the national naval medical center in bethesda , maryland , for routine microscopic examination , spokesman scott stanzel said . results are expected in two to three days . all were small , less than a centimeter -lsb- half an inch -rsb- in diameter , he said . bush is in good humor , stanzel said , and will resume his activities at camp david . during the procedure vice president dick cheney assumed presidential power . bush reclaimed presidential power at 9:21 a.m. after about two hours . doctors used `` monitored anesthesia care , '' stanzel said , so the president was asleep , but not as deeply unconscious as with a true general anesthetic . he spoke to first lady laura bush -- who is in midland , texas , celebrating her mother 's birthday -- before and after the procedure , stanzel said . afterward , the president played with his scottish terriers , barney and miss beazley , stanzel said . he planned to have lunch at camp david and have briefings with national security adviser stephen hadley and white house chief of staff josh bolten , and planned to take a bicycle ride saturday afternoon . cheney , meanwhile , spent the morning at his home on maryland 's eastern shore , reading and playing with his dogs , stanzel said . nothing occurred that required him to take official action as president before bush reclaimed presidential power . the procedure was supervised by dr. richard tubb , bush 's physician , and conducted by a multidisciplinary team from the national naval medical center in bethesda , maryland , the white house said . bush 's last colonoscopy was in june 2002 , and no abnormalities were found , white house spokesman tony snow said . the president 's doctor had recommended a repeat procedure in about five years . a colonoscopy is the most sensitive test for colon cancer , rectal cancer and polyps , small clumps of cells that can become cancerous , according to the mayo clinic . small polyps may be removed during the procedure . snow said on friday that bush had polyps removed during colonoscopies before becoming president . snow himself is undergoing chemotherapy for cancer that began in his colon and spread to his liver . watch snow talk about bush 's procedure and his own colon cancer '' `` the president wants to encourage everybody to use surveillance , '' snow said . the american cancer society recommends that people without high risk factors or symptoms begin getting screened for signs of colorectal cancer at age 50 . e-mail to a friend .
5	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the national football league has indefinitely suspended atlanta falcons quarterback michael vick without pay , officials with the league said friday . nfl star michael vick is set to appear in court monday . a judge will have the final say on a plea deal . earlier , vick admitted to participating in a dogfighting ring as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors in virginia . `` your admitted conduct was not only illegal , but also cruel and reprehensible . your team , the nfl , and nfl fans have all been hurt by your actions , '' nfl commissioner roger goodell said in a letter to vick . goodell said he would review the status of the suspension after the legal proceedings are over . in papers filed friday with a federal court in virginia , vick also admitted that he and two co-conspirators killed dogs that did not fight well . falcons owner arthur blank said vick 's admissions describe actions that are `` incomprehensible and unacceptable . '' the suspension makes `` a strong statement that conduct which tarnishes the good reputation of the nfl will not be tolerated , '' he said in a statement . watch what led to vick 's suspension '' goodell said the falcons could `` assert any claims or remedies '' to recover $ 22 million of vick 's signing bonus from the 10-year , $ 130 million contract he signed in 2004 , according to the associated press . vick said he would plead guilty to one count of `` conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in an animal fighting venture '' in a plea agreement filed at u.s. district court in richmond , virginia . the charge is punishable by up to five years in prison , a $ 250,000 fine , `` full restitution , a special assessment and 3 years of supervised release , '' the plea deal said . federal prosecutors agreed to ask for the low end of the sentencing guidelines . `` the defendant will plead guilty because the defendant is in fact guilty of the charged offense , '' the plea agreement said . in an additional summary of facts , signed by vick and filed with the agreement , vick admitted buying pit bulls and the property used for training and fighting the dogs , but the statement said he did not bet on the fights or receive any of the money won . `` most of the ` bad newz kennels ' operations and gambling monies were provided by vick , '' the official summary of facts said . gambling wins were generally split among co-conspirators tony taylor , quanis phillips and sometimes purnell peace , it continued . `` vick did not gamble by placing side bets on any of the fights . vick did not receive any of the proceeds from the purses that were won by ` bad newz kennels . ' '' vick also agreed that `` collective efforts '' by him and two others caused the deaths of at least six dogs . around april , vick , peace and phillips tested some dogs in fighting sessions at vick 's property in virginia , the statement said . `` peace , phillips and vick agreed to the killing of approximately 6-8 dogs that did not perform well in ` testing ' sessions at 1915 moonlight road and all of those dogs were killed by various methods , including hanging and drowning . `` vick agrees and stipulates that these dogs all died as a result of the collective efforts of peace , phillips and vick , '' the summary said . peace , 35 , of virginia beach , virginia ; phillips , 28 , of atlanta , georgia ; and taylor , 34 , of hampton , virginia , already have accepted agreements to plead guilty in exchange for reduced sentences . vick , 27 , is scheduled to appear monday in court , where he is expected to plead guilty before a judge . see a timeline of the case against vick '' the judge in the case will have the final say over the plea agreement . the federal case against vick focused on the interstate conspiracy , but vick 's admission that he was involved in the killing of dogs could lead to local charges , according to cnn legal analyst jeffrey toobin . `` it sometimes happens -- not often -- that the state will follow a federal prosecution by charging its own crimes for exactly the same behavior , '' toobin said friday . `` the risk for vick is , if he makes admissions in his federal guilty plea , the state of virginia could say , ` hey , look , you admitted violating virginia state law as well . we 're going to introduce that against you and charge you in our court . ' '' in the plea deal , vick agreed to cooperate with investigators and provide all information he may have on any criminal activity and to testify if necessary . vick also agreed to turn over any documents he has and to submit to polygraph tests . vick agreed to `` make restitution for the full amount of the costs associated '' with the dogs that are being held by the government . `` such costs may include , but are not limited to , all costs associated with the care of the dogs involved in that case , including if necessary , the long-term care and/or the humane euthanasia of some or all of those animals . '' prosecutors , with the support of animal rights activists , have asked for permission to euthanize the dogs . but the dogs could serve as important evidence in the cases against vick and his admitted co-conspirators . judge henry e. hudson issued an order thursday telling the u.s. marshals service to `` arrest and seize the defendant property , and use discretion and whatever means appropriate to protect and maintain said defendant property . '' both the judge 's order and vick 's filing refer to `` approximately '' 53 pit bull dogs . after vick 's indictment last month , goodell ordered the quarterback not to report to the falcons training camp , and the league is reviewing the case . blank told the nfl network on monday he could not speculate on vick 's future as a falcon , at least not until he had seen `` a statement of facts '' in the case . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's mike phelan contributed to this report .

'' turning to snow , the president then said : `` i love you , and i wish you all the best . '' snow , speaking after bush at the start of the daily white house news conference , said he was leaving to earn more money . he took a big pay cut , he said , when he left his previous jobs as anchor and political analyst for fox news . according to the washington post , snow makes $ 168,000 as the white house spokesman . his family took out a loan when he started the job , `` and that loan is now gone .

8	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- as he awaits a crucial progress report on iraq , president bush will try to put a twist on comparisons of the war to vietnam by invoking the historical lessons of that conflict to argue against pulling out . president bush pauses tuesday during a news conference at the north american leaders summit in canada . on wednesday in kansas city , missouri , bush will tell members of the veterans of foreign wars that `` then , as now , people argued that the real problem was america 's presence and that if we would just withdraw , the killing would end , '' according to speech excerpts released tuesday by the white house . `` three decades later , there is a legitimate debate about how we got into the vietnam war and how we left , '' bush will say . `` whatever your position in that debate , one unmistakable legacy of vietnam is that the price of america 's withdrawal was paid by millions of innocent citizens , whose agonies would add to our vocabulary new terms like ` boat people , ' 're - education camps ' and ` killing fields , ' '' the president will say . the president will also make the argument that withdrawing from vietnam emboldened today 's terrorists by compromising u.s. credibility , citing a quote from al qaeda leader osama bin laden that the american people would rise against the iraq war the same way they rose against the war in vietnam , according to the excerpts . `` here at home , some can argue our withdrawal from vietnam carried no price to american credibility , but the terrorists see things differently , '' bush will say . on tuesday , democratic senate majority leader harry reid said , `` president bush 's attempt to compare the war in iraq to past military conflicts in east asia ignores the fundamental difference between the two . our nation was misled by the bush administration in an effort to gain support for the invasion of iraq under false pretenses , leading to one of the worst foreign policy blunders in our history . `` while the president continues to stay-the-course with his failed strategy in iraq , paid for by the taxpayers , american lives are being lost and there is still no political solution within the iraqi government . it is time to change direction in iraq , and congress will again work to do so in the fall . '' the white house is billing the speech , along with another address next week to the american legion , as an effort to `` provide broader context '' for the debate over the upcoming iraq progress report by gen. david petraeus , the top u.s. military commander , and ryan crocker , the u.s. ambassador in baghdad . president bush has frequently asked lawmakers -- and the american people -- to withhold judgment on his troop `` surge '' in iraq until the report comes out in september . watch bush criticize the iraqi government '' it is being closely watched on capitol hill , particularly by republicans nervous about the political fallout from an increasingly unpopular war . earlier this month , defense secretary robert gates said he would wait for the report before deciding when a drawdown of the 160,000 u.s. troops in iraq might begin . bush 's speeches wednesday and next week are the latest in a series of attempts by the white house to try to reframe the debate over iraq , as public support for the war continues to sag . a recent cnn/opinion research corporation poll found that almost two-thirds of americans -- 64 percent -- now oppose the iraq war , and 72 percent say that even if petraeus reports progress , it wo n't change their opinion . the poll also found a great deal of skepticism about the report ; 53 percent said they do not trust petraeus to give an accurate assessment of the situation in iraq . in addition to his analogy to vietnam , bush in wednesday 's speech will invoke other historical comparisons from asia , including the u.s. defeat and occupation of japan after world war ii and the korean war in the 1950s , according to the excerpts . `` in the aftermath of japan 's surrender , many thought it naive to help the japanese transform themselves into a democracy . then , as now , the critics argued that some people were simply not fit for freedom , '' bush will say . `` today , in defiance of the critics , japan ... stands as one of the world 's great free societies . '' speaking about the korean war , bush will note that at the time `` critics argued that the war was futile , that we never should have sent our troops in , or that america 's intervention was divisive here at home . '' `` while it is true that the korean war had its share of challenges , america never broke its word , '' bush will say . `` without america 's intervention during the war , and our willingness to stick with the south koreans after the war , millions of south koreans would now be living under a brutal and repressive regime .

15	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a virus found in healthy australian honey bees may be playing a role in the collapse of honey bee colonies across the united states , researchers reported thursday . honey bees walk on a moveable comb hive at the bee research laboratory , in beltsville , maryland . colony collapse disorder has killed millions of bees -- up to 90 percent of colonies in some u.s. beekeeping operations -- imperiling the crops largely dependent upon bees for pollination , such as oranges , blueberries , apples and almonds . the u.s. department of agriculture says honey bees are responsible for pollinating $ 15 billion worth of crops each year in the united states . more than 90 fruits and vegetables worldwide depend on them for pollination . signs of colony collapse disorder were first reported in the united states in 2004 , the same year american beekeepers started importing bees from australia . the disorder is marked by hives left with a queen , a few newly hatched adults and plenty of food , but the worker bees responsible for pollination gone . the virus identified in the healthy australian bees is israeli acute paralysis virus -lrb- iapv -rrb- -- named that because it was discovered by hebrew university researchers . although worker bees in colony collapse disorder vanish , bees infected with iapv die close to the hive , after developing shivering wings and paralysis . for some reason , the australian bees seem to be resistant to iapv and do not come down with symptoms . scientists used genetic analyses of bees collected over the past three years and found that iapv was present in bees that had come from colony collapse disorder hives 96 percent of the time . but the study released thursday on the science express web site , operated by the journal science , cautioned that collapse disorder is likely caused by several factors . `` this research give us a very good lead to follow , but we do not believe iapv is acting alone , '' said jeffery s. pettis of the u.s. department of agriculture 's bee research laboratory and a co-author of the study . `` other stressors on the colony are likely involved . '' this could explain why bees in australia may be resistant to colony collapse . `` there are no cases ... in australia at all , '' entomologist dave britton of the australian museum told the sydney morning herald last month . `` it is a northern hemisphere phenomenon . '' bee ecology expert and university of florida professor jamie ellis said earlier this year that genetic weakness bred into bees over time , pathogens spread by parasites and the effects of pesticides and pollutants might be other factors . researchers also say varroa mites affect all hives on the u.s. mainland but are not found in australia . university of georgia bee researcher keith s. delaplane said thursday the study offers a warning -- and hope . `` one nagging problem has been a general inability to treat or vaccinate bees against viruses of any kind , '' said delaplane , who has been trying to breed bees resistant to the varroa mite . `` but in the case of iapv , there is evidence that some bees carry genetic resistance to the disorder . this is yet one more argument for beekeepers to use honey bee stocks that are genetically disease - and pest-resistant . '' bee researchers will now look for stresses that may combine to kill bees . `` the next step is to ascertain whether iapv , alone or in concert with other factors , can induce ccd -lsb- colony collapse disorder -rsb- in healthy bees , '' said ian lipkin , director of the center for infection and immunity at columbia university mailman school of public health . besides the columbia and usda researchers , others involved in the study released thursday include researchers from pennsylvania state university , the pennsylvania department of agriculture , the university of arizona and 454 life sciences . e-mail to a friend .

'' it is n't shakespeare , but it is the dramatic question hollywood filmmakers are asking about lindsay lohan following her legal troubles this week . lindsay lohan may still get work after her legal problems are settled , but the cost will be high . it is an important question , too , because whether companies insure lohan 's future movies may determine whether she will quickly fall off hollywood 's a-list . but lohan fans have little to fear because no actor is uninsurable , say underwriting experts . while some producers may balk at conditions for hiring problematic stars , experts say that unless an actor is serving time in prison , even the most volatile can be covered -- albeit at a high cost . `` for a price , anything can be done , although an insurance carrier can make things so unpalatable that at times the makers of the film just wo n't be interested , '' said ross miller , partner with insurance brokerage d.r. reiff & associates inc. . lohan 's arrest this week in los angeles on suspicion of drunken driving and cocaine possession has left hollywood wondering if the actress , who shot to fame as a child in disney films like `` the parent trap , '' is too risky to cast in a film . timeline : lindsay lohan 's troubles '' it remains to be seen whether her latest relapse and brush with the law will cost her a role in `` poor things , '' a film produced by and starring oscar-winner shirley maclaine . see a gallery of lohan 's films '' a statement was expected early next week on whether the movie , already delayed this spring due to an earlier rehab stint by lohan , will proceed with or without her . insurance experts say the industry has long dealt with similar situations , although they may seem more frequent with the recent heavy media scrutiny of lohan and fellow troubled party girls paris hilton and britney spears . `` i do n't think it -lrb- a problematic artist -rrb- is any more of an issue , '' said wendy diaz , entertainment underwriting director at fireman 's fund insurance co. , the leading film underwriter . `` it 's pretty standard year to year . '' but diaz did say the terms for covering lohan would likely be `` serious at this point . '' she said fireman 's fund , in such a case , would likely put in higher deductibles , or ask the star to put their salary into escrow to pay for any losses if production was disrupted . last july , a producer on lohan 's last film , `` georgia rule , '' scolded her publicly for repeatedly showing up late on the set , costing the movie 's makers hundreds of thousands of dollars . brian kingman , a managing director with entertainment insurance broker aon/albert g. ruben said covering situations like lohan 's required a lot of calculation and risk management . insurance rates for errant actors can range anywhere from 1 percent to 3 percent of a movie 's production budget , which can range from $ 5 million to $ 100 million or more , he said . `` filmmakers fall in love with certain actors for certain roles and my job is to find risk-takers to take on the risk , '' kingman said . he said actors were always required to undergo a medical exam before getting insurance . in certain circumstances , drug screening is conducted and actors are required to provide blood and urine samples . in cases of known drug abuse , `` minders '' are sometimes required on set to keep an eye on the actor . kingman said he had even helped craft policies for actors in the event they risked the possibility of incarceration . `` i have been successful in finding and creating incarceration coverage for certain actors on probation which can be revoked if they break certain rules , '' he said , citing the case of robert downey jr. , another high-profile star with a history of legal , drug and alcohol problems . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .

'' -rrb- . but , in the kinks ' official biography , davies tells a different story . he says `` lola '' was written after the band 's manager spent a very drunken night dancing with a woman whose five o'clock shadow was apparently obvious to everyone but him . 4 . `` 867-5309 / jenny '' written by : jim keller -lrb- of tommy tutone -rrb- and alex call . written for : unknown , as the songwriters apparently make up a different story about its inspiration every time they 're asked . while the woman continues to remain a mystery , however , the phone number is all too real . in fact , it 's been wreaking havoc ever since 1982 and the passage of time has n't quelled of the number of crank calls . in 1999 , brown university freshman roommates nina clemente and jahanaz mirza found that out the hard way , when the school adopted an 867 exchange number for its on-campus phone system . immediately , the girls ' innocuous room no. 5309 became a magnet for every drunk college kid with a 1980s fetish . other unfortunate phone customers have fought back with creative and profitable solutions , like the holder of 212-867-5309 , who put his phone number up for auction on ebay in 2004 . bids approached $ 100,000 before ebay pulled the item at the request of verizon , the number 's actual owner . 5 . `` oh , carol '' written by : neil sedaka . written for : carole king , naturally . sedaka and king actually dated briefly in high school -- a romance sedaka was able to successfully milk with `` oh , carol , '' a then top-10 -lrb- if now somewhat forgettable -rrb- 1959 pop song . however , the real success of `` oh , carol '' came a few months later , when it inspired king to write a rebuttal entitled `` oh , neil . '' at the time , king and her husband , gerry goffin , were fledgling songwriters in need of a hit tune . `` oh , neil '' was n't that , but it did pay off . after sedaka gave a tape of the song to his boss , king and goffin landed jobs at the legendary brill building pop music factory , where the duo went on to write chart-toppers like `` will you still love me tomorrow '' and `` the loco-motion . '' 6 . `` it ai n't me , babe '' written by : bob dylan . written for : joan baez , though it clearly was n't the nicest gift dylan could have given her . the two met in 1961 , when baez was an up-and-coming folk singer and dylan was a nobody from minnesota . desperate to make his break in the music biz , dylan worked like crazy to get baez 's attention . he eventually ended up going on tour with her , which is how he first became famous , and also how the two began dating . for a while , they seemed like the golden couple , but things soon went downhill . during a european concert tour together in early 1965 , they had a huge fight and parted ways . that may , dylan was holed up in a hotel after being hospitalized with a virus , and baez , hoping to remain friends , decided to bring him flowers . sadly , that 's how she found out that her ex was already dating someone else . that someone else was sara lownds , whom dylan married a mere six months later . 7 . `` our house '' written by : graham nash -lrb- of crosby , stills , nash & young -rrb- . written for : joni mitchell . in december 1968 , nash and mitchell moved into a cozy little house in the laurel canyon section of los angeles . though commonly left out of the hippy pantheon , laurel canyon was sort of a commune-home away from commune-home for san francisco society -- not just csn&y , but also jim morrison , the eagles , frank zappa , and more . `` our house '' was directly inspired by a lazy sunday in the nash/mitchell household . the couple went out to brunch , hit an antiques store , and then returned to find the house just a bit chilly , at which point nash literally `` lit a fire , '' while mitchell `` placed the flowers in the vase that she bought that day . '' no , really . the whole tableau seemed so ridiculously domestic to nash that he immediately sat down and spent the rest of the day writing about it . e-mail to a friend .
22	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- youssif , the 5-year-old burned iraqi boy , rounded the corner at universal studios when suddenly the little boy hero met his favorite superhero . youssif has always been a huge spider-man fan . meeting him was `` my favorite thing , '' he said . spider-man was right smack dab in front of him , riding a four-wheeler amid a convoy of other superheroes . the legendary climber of buildings and fighter of evil dismounted , walked over to youssif and introduced himself . spidey then gave the boy from a far-away land a gentle hug , embracing him in his iconic blue and red tights . he showed youssif a few tricks , like how to shoot a web from his wrist . only this time , no web was spun . `` all right youssif ! '' spider-man said after the boy mimicked his wrist movement . other superheroes crowded around to get a closer look . even the green goblin stopped his villainous ways to tell the boy hi . youssif remained unfazed . he did n't take a liking to spider-man 's nemesis . spidey was just too cool . `` it was my favorite thing , '' the boy said later . `` i want to see him again . '' he then felt compelled to add : `` i know it 's not the real spider-man . '' this was the day of dreams when the boy 's nightmares were , at least temporarily , forgotten . he met spongebob , lassie and a 3-year-old orangutan named archie . the hairy , brownish-red primate took to the boy , grabbing his hand and holding it . even when youssif pulled away , archie would inch his hand back toward the boy 's and then snatch it . see youssif enjoy being a boy again '' the boy giggled inside a play area where sponge-like balls shot out of toy guns . it was a far different artillery than what he was used to seeing in central baghdad , as recently as a week ago . he squealed with delight and raced around the room collecting as many balls as he could . he rode a tram through the back stages at universal studios . at one point , the car shook . fire and smoke filled the air , debris cascaded down and a big rig skidded toward the vehicle . the boy and his family survived the pretend earthquake unscathed . `` even i was scared , '' the dad said . `` well , i was n't , '' youssif replied . the father and mother grinned from ear to ear throughout the day . youssif pushed his 14-month-old sister , ayaa , in a stroller . `` did you even need to ask us if we were interested in coming here ? '' youssif 's father said in amazement . `` other than my wedding day , this is the happiest day of my life , '' he said . just a day earlier , the mother and father talked about their journey out of iraq and to the united states . they also discussed that day nine months ago when masked men grabbed their son outside the family home , doused him in gas and set him on fire . his mother heard her boy screaming from inside . the father sought help for his boy across baghdad , but no one listened . he remembers his son 's two months of hospitalization . the doctors did n't use anesthetics . he could hear his boy 's piercing screams from the other side of the hospital . watch youssif meet his doctor and play with his little sister '' the father knew that speaking to cnn would put his family 's lives in jeopardy . the possibility of being killed was better than seeing his son suffer , he said . `` anything for youssif , '' he said . `` we had to do it . '' they described a life of utter chaos in baghdad . neighbors had recently given birth to a baby girl . shortly afterward , the father was kidnapped and killed . then , there was the time when some girls wore tanktops and jeans . they were snatched off the street by gunmen . the stories can be even more gruesome . the couple said they had heard reports that a young girl was kidnapped and beheaded -- and her killers sewed a dog 's head on the corpse and delivered it to her family 's doorstep . `` these are just some of the stories , '' said youssif 's mother , zainab . under saddam hussein , there was more security and stability , they said . there was running water and electricity most of the time . but still life was tough under the dictator , like the time when zainab 's uncle disappeared and was never heard from again after he read a `` religious book , '' she said . sitting in the parking lot of a target in suburban los angeles , youssif 's father watched as husbands and wives , boyfriends and girlfriends , parents and their children , came and went . some held hands . others smiled and laughed . `` iraq finished , '' he said in what few english words he knows . he elaborated in arabic : his homeland wo n't be enjoying such freedoms anytime soon . it 's just not possible . too much violence . too many killings . his two children have only seen war . but this week , the family has seen a much different side of america -- an outpouring of generosity and a peaceful nation at home . `` it 's been a dream , '' the father said . he used to do a lot of volunteer work back in baghdad . `` maybe that 's why i 'm being helped now , '' the father said . at universal studios , he looked out across the valley below . the sun glistened off treetops and buildings . it was a picturesque sight fit for a hollywood movie . `` good america , good america , '' he said in english . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's arwa damon contributed to this report .
23	las vegas , nevada -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- former football star o.j. simpson will be held without bail after his arrest on robbery and assault charges , police announced late sunday . police released this mug shot of o.j. simpson after his arrest . simpson is accused of having directed several other men in an alleged armed robbery of sports memorabilia in a room at a las vegas hotel room . las vegas authorities said they have no information leading them to believe simpson was carrying a firearm during the alleged incident at the palace station hotel and casino . police said simpson and other men burst into the room and walked out with the memorabilia , including some that was unrelated to simpson , police said . `` we do n't believe that anyone was roughed up , but there were firearms involved , '' lt. clint nichols told reporters . nichols said the firearms were pointed at the victims . a reporter asked nichols : was `` o.j. was the boss in that room ? '' nichols responded , `` that is what we believe , yes . '' watch simpson transferred sunday in handcuffs '' the alleged victims were identified as bruce fromong , a sports memorabilia collector who described the incident as `` a home invasion-type robbery , '' and alfred beardsley , who has been quoted by celebrity web site tmz.com as saying that simpson later apologized to him and told him he regretted the incident . acting on a tip , police met over the weekend at mccarran international airport with 46-year-old walter alexander , of mesa , arizona , who told them about the alleged robbery and validated the tipster 's information , capt. james dillon told reporters . alexander was arrested saturday night on two counts of robbery with a deadly weapon , two counts of assault with a deadly weapon , conspiracy to commit robbery and burglary with a deadly weapon . he was released on his own recognizance and returned to mesa either saturday night or early sunday morning , dillon said . in addition , investigators are seeking four other men they believe accompanied simpson into the hotel room , nichols said . nichols said , `` there is a social relationship between the individuals that we identified and o.j. simpson . '' though simpson is not accused of having brandished a gun himself , two firearms that police said were used were recovered early sunday in one of three searches . investigators would would not divulge where the weapons were found . nichols dismissed an initial report that the men may have been off-duty police . `` there is no truth to that whatsoever , '' he said . `` that came as a result of some language that was used when the individuals burst into the room that led our victims to believe that they may have been police . '' simpson , 60 , has acknowledged taking some items that belonged to him , but he has denied that any weapons were involved . `` whether the property belonged to mr. simpson or not is still in debate , '' nichols said . `` we are still in the process of sorting that out . '' nichols also said that some of the property taken had simpson 's signature . but `` there was some other property taken as well , '' he said . `` i believe there were some joe montana cleats and some signed baseballs and other stuff . '' the latest charges against simpson mean he faces the prospect of another prosecution , more than a decade after the june 1994 stabbing deaths of his ex-wife , nicole brown simpson , and ron goldman . simpson was acquitted of murder the following year . the trial riveted much of the united states . but in 1997 , a jury found him liable for the deaths in a civil case brought by the goldman family . simpson was ordered to pay the families a total of $ 33.5 million for the deaths . goldman had gone to nicole simpson 's los angeles home to return a pair of glasses the day of the slayings . goldman 's sister , kim goldman , said she was n't surprised by the robbery allegations , since simpson `` thinks he can do no wrong . '' `` he 's capable of stabbing people to death , so i think robbery is nothing surprising , '' she said . `` normal , logical , civil-minded , law-abiding people do n't storm a room with guns demanding stuff back . '' fromong had testified on simpson 's behalf in the civil case , telling the court that prices for simpson memorabilia had dropped substantially since the 1995 verdict . his testimony was part of the defense 's contention that simpson could not afford to pay the goldmans . simpson recently wrote a book originally titled `` if i did it '' and had planned to publish it himself , but a public outcry led to the cancellation of his book deal . a bankruptcy judge subsequently awarded the goldmans the rights to the book in light of their inability to collect the wrongful death award . the goldmans retitled the book , `` if i did it : confessions of the killer .

26	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a former government contract employee was indicted on charges of stealing restricted nuclear energy-related materials and putting the united states at risk , the department of justice announced thursday . sources say the classified materials were taken from the east tennessee technology park . roy lynn oakley , 67 , of roane county , tennessee , appeared in federal court in knoxville on thursday . oakley was briefly detained for questioning in the case in january , when authorities first learned of the alleged plot to divulge the materials , government sources told cnn . he voluntarily surrendered thursday at an fbi field office in knoxville , the sources said . oakley is a former employee of bechtel jacobs , the department of energy 's prime environmental management contractor at the east tennessee technology park , prosecutors said . the indictment states that oakley , `` having possession of , access to and having been entrusted with sections of ` barriers ' and associated hardware used for uranium enrichment through the process of gaseous diffusion ... having reason to believe that such data would be utilized to injure the united states and secure an advantage to a foreign nation , did communicate , transmit and disclose such data to another person . '' the transfer took place january 26 , the indictment alleges . oakley is also charged with converting the material and `` restricted data '' to his own use . he began doing so on about october 17 , 2006 , and continued through january , prosecutors said . prosecutors said the materials involved have been examined by scientists and posed no threat to people who may have come into contact with them . oakley 's attorney , herb moncier , said outside court thursday that oakley 's job was to break rods `` into little pieces '' and throw them away . moncier said oakley had a security clearance , but moncier did not believe it was a high-level clearance . the government alleges that in january , oakley attempted to sell the `` pieces of scrap '' to someone he thought was a french agent -- but in reality was an undercover fbi agent , moncier said . he said he questions whether those broken pieces would be considered an `` appliance '' under the law . `` mr. oakley has cooperated fully for the last six months , '' said moncier , who added that he had traveled to washington for work on the case . each count carries a possible sentence upon conviction of up to 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine . `` while none of the stolen equipment was ever transmitted to a foreign government or terrorist organization , the facts of this case demonstrate the importance of safeguarding our nuclear technology and pursuing aggressive prosecution against those who attempt to breach the safeguards and put that technology in the wrong hands , '' kenneth wainstein , assistant attorney general for national security , said in the justice department statement . one government source said the materials involved are not the `` crown jewels , '' but they should not have been taken from the facility . a `` barrier '' is used to filter uranium during the enrichment process , according to nuclear energy officials , but a significant number of barriers are needed to do that job . sources told cnn that federal authorities have been following oakley and investigating the case for at least six months , after he allegedly tried to sell the classified material . oakley , described as a low-level employee , apparently did not make contact with any foreign government and is not a foreign agent of any kind , an official familiar with the case said . a government official with with knowledge of the case said that when authorities learned of oakley 's alleged intentions six months ago , the fbi and department of energy launched a joint investigation . the fbi then developed a sting operation , government officials familiar with the case said , and authorities intervened before there could be any involvement of a foreign country . east tennessee technology park is an area of the doe 's oak ridge reservation `` where we are currently decontaminating and decommissioning buildings that were last used in 1985 , '' gerald boyd , manager of the doe 's oak ridge site office , said thursday . `` when they were in use , now over 20 years ago , some of the buildings at ettp housed facilities used for the enrichment of uranium . '' boyd said the technology park and the reservation `` are protected by multiple layers of security systems and detection programs , both visible and unseen , meant to identify rogue employees attempting to abuse their access and position .

28	hong kong , china -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- paul lee got his liver from an executed chinese prisoner ; karam in egypt bought a kidney for his sister for $ 5,300 ; in istanbul hakan is holding out for $ 30,700 for one of his kidneys . doctors in pakistan have been arrested for abducting people , drugging them and stealing their kidneys . they are not so unusual : a dire shortage of donated organs in rich countries is sending foreigners with end-stage illnesses to poorer places like china , pakistan , turkey , egypt , colombia and the philippines to buy a new lease of life . lee , a 53-year-old chief subway technician in hong kong , was diagnosed with liver cancer in january 2005 but doctors denied him a transplant because they feared the tumor would spread . a friend told him about a transplant hospital in china 's north eastern tianjin city and he signed up for a place . that april , he paid 260,000 yuan -lrb- $ 34,380 -rrb- for a transplant -- surgery that saved his life . `` the hospital has connections with a lot of prisons , '' lee told reuters . `` mine came from an executed prisoner from heilongjiang . i thank the donor deeply . '' the world health organization estimates that 21,000 liver transplants are carried out annually , but medical experts put annual worldwide demand at at least 90,000 . demand for kidneys also exceeds supply , and that has given rise to organ trafficking and a black market for rich people and `` transplant tourists '' who travel to poor countries to buy body parts from people with few other routes to a better living . a donor in south africa receives $ 700 for a kidney compared with $ 30,000 in the united states . a lack of transparency and little protection for donors has spurred calls by international bodies to crack down on , or at least regulate , the trade . but even where the trade is banned , laws are often muddled or laced with loopholes , which are sometimes defended by vested interests . and the unregulated route is much less complicated for the recipient . any transplant procedure involving a living donor carries risks for the donor -- especially for liver transplants which involve removing part of the donor 's liver . the complications can include bleeding , infection , even death . in the transplant trade , the recipient need not worry about , for example , exposing a living relative to that risk . `` it is cheaper and your next of kin is not taking the risk and you do n't have to care for someone you do n't know . once you pay , it is discarded in a way , it is dispensable , '' said luc noel , a geneva-based coordinator for clinical procedures at the world health organization . china recently banned the sale of human organs and restricted transplants for foreigners , saying it must first meet demand at home for 2 million organs a year . only 20,000 transplants are carried out in china each year . of these , 3,000 are liver transplants and 95 percent of them use livers from dead donors . china defended its use of organs from executed prisoners , saying consent was obtained from convicts or their families . a transplant operation using the liver of a dead donor costs around $ 33,000 in china . `` what is important is the transparency , it has to be open to scrutiny ... if china makes its current system open to scrutiny and very transparent , that would do good , '' said the who 's noel . in asia , a cultural obsession with keeping the body of the deceased intact has stymied public organ donation programs . excluding china , asia has fewer than 200 livers donated by people ahead of their death each year , said lo chung-man , professor of hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgery at the university of hong kong . pakistan , where trade in human organs is not illegal , is turning into a `` kidney bazaar '' , said the chief executive of pakistan 's kidney foundation , jaffar naqvi . there are no confirmed figures for the number of foreigners coming to the country for new kidneys but naqvi said there were 13 centers in lahore alone which reported more than 2,000 transplants last year from bought kidneys . patients , mostly from europe , saudi arabia and india , pay about 500,000 rupees -lrb- $ 8,500 -rrb- for a new kidney , he said . donors are paid $ 300 to $ 1,000 and often get no medical care after the surgery . there is no consent in some cases . in may police arrested nine people , four of them doctors , for abducting people , drugging them and stealing their kidneys for transplant operations . in the pipeline is a draft law aimed at banning the trade , but a powerful lobby bent on preserving it is trying to ensure it allows kidney donations for a non-relative , with no payment . such a clause allowing `` altruistic '' organ donations will ensure the trade continues with secret payment to donors , naqvi said . stories of people selling their organs , especially kidneys , are not uncommon in egypt , where more than 30 percent of a population of more than 73 million people live below the poverty line . karam , who asked to be identified only by his first name because organ trading is illegal , said it took him only 15 days to secure a kidney for his sister who was suffering from kidney failure . he said a doctor found him a man willing to sell his kidney for 30,000 egyptian pounds -lrb- $ 5,300 -rrb- . `` the fees of the doctor were 5,000 pounds . both his money and the fees of the hospital were deducted from the money the ` donor ' received , '' said karam . he said doctors usually help in finding people willing to sell their organs from their patients ' lists . abdel-kader hegazy , head of the disciplinary committee at the doctors ' union , said egyptian law lacks clear punishment for those involved in illegal transplants , making it easy for doctors to repeat the offence . `` the law says it is illegal to trade in organs but does not specify the punishment . we at the union suspended many doctors and closed their practices , but they have appealed before courts and won their licenses back , '' he told reuters . `` it is an annoying and a regrettable situation . well-known doctors and professors are doing this . they are rich people but they do it because they have no moral values . '' the union has been pushing for legislation to regulate organ transplants , with a draft bill including heavy fines and a prison sentence for those involved and a ban on transplants between people of different nationalities . but the draft law has been languishing in parliament for several years because of differences between doctors and senior muslim religious leaders on whether islam allows organ transplants in the case of clinical deaths . in turkey , students , unemployed young men and struggling fathers post adverts on the internet selling their kidneys , listing their drinking and smoking habits and blood type . these would-be donors say they have had enquiries from germany , israel and turkey with asking prices going up to 50,000 lira -lrb- $ 38,760 -rrb- . hakan , a 27-year-old security guard in istanbul with two young children who also requested only his first name be published , told reuters he received five or six offers from turkey and germany , offering 10,000-15 ,000 lira -lrb- $ 11,600 -rrb- , but he 's holding out for 40,000 lira . `` of course it 's frightening but there 's nothing else to be done , '' he said , adding he had n't told his wife as he knew she would object . `` i 'm doing it because of my family , if i was alone it would n't matter . i 've got two children ... there 's nothing else i can do for them .

30	phuket , thailand -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- relatives of the 89 people killed in sunday 's plane crash in phuket continued to arrive in the thai resort town on tuesday to try to identify their loved ones ' remains . a buddhist monk blesses the wreckage of one-two-go airline 's md-82 jet at phuket airport on tuesday . most of those killed were foreign nationals , and about 36 of the bodies still have yet to be identified , according to thailand 's state-run thai news agency -lrb- tna -rrb- . all of the unidentified victims were foreign nationals , it reported . the u.s. embassy in bangkok said that five americans were among those killed when the one-two-go jet crashed in bad weather as it landed at phuket 's airport on sunday . u.s. officials had previously confirmed that four americans died in the crash , and one survived . eight british nationals are believed to have died , according to foreign secretary david miliband . he said three were still in hospital , with one in a critical condition . thailand 's public health minister mongkol na songkhla said that of the 41 survivors who remain hospitalized , 38 were in stable condition and three in critical condition , according to tna . flight 269 was carrying 123 passengers and seven crew members when it left bangkok for phuket on sunday afternoon . nationalities of the survivors include british , american , swedish , iranian , austrian , australian , thai , german , irish , italian , israeli and dutch , authorities said . watch a survivor recall the fiery horror '' one man who arrived in phuket on tuesday from paris described a frustrating process of trying to communicate with thai officials in his effort to locate the remains of his brother . for some families , dna testing may be the only way to positively identify their relatives . meanwhile , buddhist , christian and muslim leaders gathered outside phuket 's airport on tuesday to remember those killed . the investigation into what caused the crash continues , but the strong winds and rain are a suspected factor . u.s. officials are aiding in the investigation because the aircraft -- a boeing md-82 -- was manufactured in the united states . one air traffic controller at phuket airport said pilots were warned of possible wind shear , which is dramatic changes in wind speed and direction . airport officials said that the wind at the time of the crash was 17 kilometers an hour -lrb- 11 miles an hour -rrb- with stronger gusts , but no planes were delayed or diverted because of the weather conditions . the decision to land was the pilot 's alone , according to phuket 's airport manager . `` air traffic control would give weather information to pilot and warning information but the final decision is dependent on the pilot , '' pornchai eua-aree said . one-two-go officials would not speculate on what may have happened , saying they will wait for the findings of the investigation . but they did say their aircraft were regularly checked and maintained , and denied some media reports that questioned whether the discount airline employed more inexperienced pilots for lower salaries . one-two-go is one of about 40 low-cost airlines operating in asia , and the industry will be watching closely for the results of the investigation into the crash . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's andrew stevens contributed to this report .
31	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- prince harry led tributes to diana , princess of wales on the 10th anniversary of her death , describing her as `` the best mother in the world '' in a speech at a memorial service . here is his speech in full : . william and i can separate life into two parts . there were those years when we were blessed with the physical presence beside us of both our mother and father . princes harry and william greet guests at a thanksgiving service in memory of their mother . and then there are the 10 years since our mother 's death . when she was alive , we completely took for granted her unrivaled love of life , laughter , fun and folly . she was our guardian , friend and protector . she never once allowed her unfaltering love for us to go unspoken or undemonstrated . she will always be remembered for her amazing public work . but behind the media glare , to us , just two loving children , she was quite simply the best mother in the world . we would say that , would n't we . but we miss her . she kissed us last thing at night . her beaming smile greeted us from school . she laughed hysterically and uncontrollably when sharing something silly she might have said or done that day . she encouraged us when we were nervous or unsure . she -- like our father -- was determined to provide us with a stable and secure childhood . to lose a parent so suddenly at such a young age , as others have experienced , is indescribably shocking and sad . it was an event which changed our lives forever , as it must have done for everyone who lost someone that night . but what is far more important to us now , and into the future , is that we remember our mother as she would have wished to be remembered as she was : fun-loving , generous , down-to-earth , entirely genuine . we both think of her every day . we speak about her and laugh together at all the memories . put simply , she made us , and so many other people , happy . may this be the way that she is remembered . prince william 's reading from st paul 's letter to the ephesians : . i bow my knees before the father , from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name . i pray that , according to the riches of his glory , he may grant that you may be strengthened in your inner being with power through his spirit , and that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith , as you are being rooted and grounded in love . i pray that you may have the power to comprehend , with all the saints , what is the breadth and length and height and depth , and to know the love of christ that surpasses knowledge , so that you may be filled with all the fullness of god . now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine , to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus to all generations , for ever and ever . amen . thanks be to god . the bishop of london 's speech : . `` who 's cheating ? '' the scene is an old people 's home . two residents are playing beggar my neighbor . enter the princess . the question from the royal visitor is unexpected but everyone laughs . afterwards they comment on her large eyes and what life she brought into the room . one tiny incident , characteristic of countless other occasions in the princess 's public life in which she found the right word or the right gesture to bring cheer and comfort . everyone here will have their own memories . i remember meeting princess diana for the very first time early in 1981 to discuss details of the wedding service in st paul 's . even archbishop 's chaplains have their share of proper diffidence and i was nervous entering the presence . it must have been a bewildering time for the princess as well , but even then , at the age of 20 , her capacity for empathy and her very strong intuitive power ensured that any tension soon evaporated . prince harry has spoken movingly and justly , as few others have the right to do , about the princess as a mother . i want to dwell for a moment on her public work , its cost and its meaning . after her marriage , the princess joined her natural gifts of beauty , empathy and powerful intuition with that extraordinary charge which association with the royal family generates . led by our queen and other members of the royal family , our constitution has developed in response to the challenges of the past century . there is a properly political sphere in which the monarch may counsel but does n't intrude , but there is another sphere , vital to any sense of national unity and creativity , a sphere in which communities must be celebrated , common values articulated and the transcendent source of those values honored . we tend to be suspicious of public figures who wrap themselves in divinity and claim that their will is god 's will , but if no-one can articulate in an un-ignorable way in the public realm the creative energy of the love that we see in christ , the human face of god , then we shall find ourselves inhabiting a maimed and diminished society . and at a time when people are suspicious of rhetoric , the monarchy communicates by symbol and by simple speech , and the princess brought her own gifts to this work . she was still only 26 in 1987 when she shook the hand of a patient at the opening of the middlesex hospital 's aids ward . it was the first in the uk and it is very hard now to credit the degree of fear and prejudice which surrounded aids in the '80s . those familiar with the field have no doubt that the princess played a significant part in overcoming a harmful and even a cruel taboo in a gesture which was not choreographed but sprung from a deep identification with those who were vulnerable and on the margin . and she had a similar impact in the usa . an editorial in the new york times in 1989 admitted ruefully that it had taken a foreign , and even a royal , dignitary to draw attention to a major public health concern in the us . her work in the very last year of her life for the victims of landmines also caught the popular imagination internationally and certainly accelerated the adoption of the ottawa convention , banning the use of a weapon which disproportionately kills and maims women and children . she proved the eloquence of embrace and of touch which , of course , have been used by royal healers throughout the centuries . and as she said , in her words , `` the biggest disease today is not leprosy or tb but the feeling of being unwanted '' . she sought out places of suffering , because they are so very often places of truth where the masks have been removed , and she was not afraid to be with the dying and to comfort them in an unsentimental way . bill deedes accompanied her on some of her visits . his response to the cynics was typically robust . he said : `` she was one who sought above all to help vulnerable people in society and who did it so well . she was good at this because she herself was vulnerable . she knew the feeling . she did n't set out to be a saint . '' the role brought great power but , like any member of the royal family , she also experienced the weight of expectation and the intensity of the scrutiny . honoring but managing the role and not allowing it to take over one 's personal humanity is a desperately difficult task . as we have heard from prince harry , his mother diana did all that she could to prepare her sons for the work which lies ahead . she confessed to receiving a very great deal from some of those whose lives she touched . she said of john , a young greek suffering from cystic fibrosis : `` he showed no sign of anger , no trace of bitterness but touched us all with an aura of optimism and hope for the future such that i have never before encountered . '' the love of christ described in the lesson read by prince william contains the essence of the spiritual life . princess diana recognized this quality of life in many of those , like john , whose lives she touched . it was a mystery which resonated deeply with her and for which she reached out . and the mystery is this - the more you go beyond yourself , the more you will become your true self ; the more you lose yourself in loving and serving others , the more you will find yourself ; the more you keep company with those who suffer , the more you will be healed . this is the knowledge which passes all understanding . this is certain and has been proved experimentally in the life of all the saints . it 's easy to lose the real person in the image , to insist that all is darkness or all is light . still , 10 years after her tragic death , there are regular reports of `` fury '' at this or that incident , and the princess 's memory is used for scoring points . let it end here . let this service mark the point at which we let her rest in peace and dwell on her memory with thanksgiving and compassion . let us also , echoing the words of prince harry , look to the future and pray , in the words of st paul , for all those who serve our country as members of the royal family and most especially for the sons who were so precious to her : . `` i pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power with all the saints to grasp what is the breadth and length and depth and height of the love of christ and to know this love which surpasses knowledge that you might be filled with the fullness of god .

'' watch a report on blackwater 's response to the allegations '' the first public hint that an investigation was under way came earlier this week in a statement from state department inspector general howard krongard after he was accused of blocking fraud investigations in afghanistan and iraq . krongard said the state department has been cooperating with the prosecutors in the blackwater probe . `` in particular , i made one of my best investigators available to help assistant u.s. attorneys in north carolina in their investigation into alleged smuggling of weapons into iraq by a contractor , '' krongard 's statement said . blackwater resumed normal security operations in iraq on friday , the state department said , after a brief hiatus following the lethal incident last sunday . the iraqi government was outraged by the shootings and disputes the u.s. and blackwater 's claim that the guards were responding to an attack . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's elise labott and kelli arena contributed to this report .
33	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- filmmaker michael moore , whose new documentary `` sicko '' takes on america 's health care system , faced off tuesday with cnn chief medical correspondent and practicing neurosurgeon dr. sanjay gupta . michael moore and cnn 's sanjay gupta argued tuesday about gupta 's report on moore 's film `` sicko '' moore criticized a report gupta did on cnn monday on `` sicko . '' `` he said the facts were fudged , '' moore said , referring to gupta , on cnn 's `` larry king live . '' `` that 's a lie . none of the facts are fudged . '' moore and gupta shouted and argued over data gupta used and data moore used . moore said his staffers backed up the film 's facts to gupta before the report aired and that gupta aired it knowing his facts were wrong . gupta disputed that . watch moore , gupta make their points '' `` we try and look for some of the best sources we can possibly find , '' he said . `` michael has a lot of different numbers . ... you 're sort of cherry-picking data from different reports . '' both agreed , however , on the basic premise of `` sicko '' : problems abound in america 's health-care system and need to be fixed . `` i thought it was a good movie , and i wanted to say that , '' gupta said . `` i think it strikes at the irrefutable fact -- it 's broken . we get it . '' he praised moore for raising awareness of the issue . however , gupta said he was concerned that the movie -- which notes that other developed nations such as france and canada have universal health care -- suggests that health care in those countries is free . while patients may not pay for services at the doctor 's office , they do pay high taxes to fund such a system , something gupta said he was concerned that `` sicko '' audiences might not realize . moore responded by saying americans pay more in copays , deductibles and insurance premiums . `` we -lsb- america -rsb- have a system built on profit , '' the moviemaker said . he asked gupta if the current system , which requires him to receive approval from an insurance company before performing some procedures , is cumbersome to him . `` it 's a shameful system , especially when i 'm dealing with some of my patients , '' gupta said . but he questioned moore 's apparent solution -- putting health care in the hands of the bush administration , which moore fiercely criticized in the past , particularly in his film `` fahrenheit 9/11 . '' `` the government actually used to do things right , '' moore said in response . `` the problem is who we put in power . '' moore has adamantly opposed the war in iraq and said the government should reprioritize -- a position he took many years before skepticism of the war 's success abounded in washington . `` i am sorry we 've taken so much time trying to correct -lsb- gupta 's -rsb- facts here tonight instead of talking about the real issue '' -- the ailing health care system , moore said . e-mail to a friend .
34	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- french foreign minister bernard kouchner 's declaration that france had to prepare for the possibility of war against iran over its nuclear program was not conventional diplomatic behavior . but then kouchner was never expected to be a soft-soaper on the diplomatic scene . french foreign minister bernard kouchner has a reputation for challenging convention and authority . a surprise appointment from the socialist ranks to nicolas sarkozy 's conservative government , the founder of medicins sans frontiers has always challenged convention and authority . the former un secretary general boutros boutros-ghali once called kouchner ` an unguided missile ' and the man himself has been known to declare : `` to change the law you sometimes have to break the law '' . he was in his youth one of the leaders of the students revolt in france in may 1968 . kouchner is a humanitarian as well as a patriot , with a strong commitment to human rights . unusually for a man of the left , he supported the us-led intervention in iraq -lrb- while criticizing the aftermath -rrb- . but he did so on the grounds of saddam hussein 's denial of human rights , not his possible possession of weapons of mass destruction . his and president sarkozy 's concern for human rights lies behind their eagerness to join gordon brown 's britain in a new push for action in darfur . bernard kouchner did not come to his position with any of former president chirac 's instinctive distrust of the united states . washington , which has been critical of some european states for their weakness in confronting teheran , will have been delighted by his ` get serious ' warning to teheran . but the plain-speaking kouchner is unlikely to be deterred by fears of upsetting the white house when he has criticisms to make of us policy . how much should be made of his words on iran remains unclear at this stage . they were scarcely on the same scale as president chirac 's threat when he was still in office to retaliate with nuclear strikes against any state found to be responsible for a large-scale terrorist attack on france . but they are all of a piece with france 's new high-profile style under the presidency of nicolas sarkozy . mr kouchner , for example , became the first french foreign minister to visit iraq since 1988 , insisting that there could only be a political solution to the country 's problems , not a military one , and offering france 's services as a mediator and ` honest broker ' between sunnis , shiites and kurds . on iran he is , in a way , merely echoing the words of his president who declared in a speech last month that a nuclear-armed iran would be ` unacceptable ' and describing the stand-off over its nuclear program as ` undoubtedly the most serious crisis before us today ' . certainly mr kouchner is making clear that france no longer takes the view once expressed by president chirac that a nuclear-armed iran might be inevitable . in continuing to ratchet up the rhetoric over that threat and to underline the west 's resolution on iran 's nuclear enrichment program mr kouchner is supplementing his president 's warnings . neither is saying that military intervention against iran is imminent or inevitable . neither has yet confirmed that france would be part of any such military action . but both are stressing the risks which are piling up as a result of teheran 's brinkmanship . perhaps the strongest lesson though from mr kouchner 's intervention is his underlining that the new administration in france is not a knee-jerk anti-american one -- and that france is in the business of reclaiming a role at the top diplomatic tables . e-mail to a friend .

36	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- some democrats appear to be wavering on a highly contentious house resolution labeling turkey 's treatment of armenians in world war i as genocide . a kc-135 tanker lands at incirlik air base in southern turkey in 2003 . turkey , a longtime u.s. ally and nato partner , was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of armenians by ottoman turks genocide and threatened to block access to incirlik air base after the resolution passed a house committee vote . the base , in southern turkey near syria , is a major resupply center for u.s. operations in iraq and elsewhere in the mideast and asia . the pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in iraq if turkey cuts off u.s. access to the strategically important incirlik , military officials said tuesday . ankara acknowledges the killings of armenians during world war i but vehemently objects to the `` genocide '' label . the house foreign affairs committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution . house speaker nancy pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full house sometime next month . but the bush administration urged congress to drop the issue , and some leading democrats urged pelosi not to bring it to the floor . majority leader steny hoyer signaled tuesday that the vote might be put off . `` i said i thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here , '' said hoyer of maryland . `` i have not changed on that , although i would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions . we will have to determine where everybody is . '' democratic rep. ike skelton , the chairman of the house armed services committee , announced his opposition to the resolution last week . and democratic reps. alcee hastings of florida and john tanner of tennessee , both members of the u.s. house delegation to nato , urged pelosi to reconsider in a letter released tuesday . `` more than half of the cargo flown into iraq and afghanistan comes through incirlik air base , and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future , '' they wrote . lt. gen. carter ham , the director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff , said pentagon planners are looking at `` a broad range of options '' to keep food , fuel and ammunition flowing to u.s. troops in iraq if turkey blocks incirlik . `` we 're confident that we 'll find ways to do that , '' ham told reporters at the pentagon . `` there 's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that , and obviously we 'd prefer to maintain the access that we have . '' defense secretary robert gates echoed lawmakers ' concerns last week . `` about 70 percent of all air cargo going into iraq goes through turkey . ... about a third of the fuel that they consume goes through turkey or comes from turkey , '' gates said . he also said that 95 percent of the mine-resistant ambush-protective vehicles , or mraps , being deployed in iraq are flown through turkey . the vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs . see incirlik 's key location '' the u.s. military issued a `` warning order '' a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews , planes , fuel and routes are lined up if turkey stops or restricts u.s. access to incirlik , a source said . jordan and kuwait are among the alternatives the united states is considering . some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the turks to attack kurdish rebels in northern iraq which could further complicate iraqi stability , u.s. officials said . incirlik offers 10,000 - and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters , according globalsecurity.org , a source of background information about military issues . globalsecurity said incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to iraq , taking over for rhein-main air base in germany because it is closer to iraq , reducing the strain on troops and aircraft . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's barbara starr and deirdre walsh contributed to this report .
37	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a wide-open presidential race and a willingness by candidates , interest groups , unions and corporations to buy tv time will lead to historic spending for political and issue-advocacy advertising in the 2008 election cycle , an analysis shows . former massachusetts gov. mitt romney has spent the most on tv advertising so far among presidential contenders . the cost to try to influence the 2008 election could exceed $ 3 billion , according to tns media intelligence/campaign media analysis group , cnn 's consultant on political television advertising . this is nearly twice as much than what was spent in 2004 when political and issue-advocacy television advertising rang in at $ 1.7 billion . in 2006 , $ 2.3 billion was spent on political and issue-advocacy tv commercials . just about every candidate running for an office from dogcatcher to president is spending the money , said evan tracey , cmag 's chief operating officer . the costs to produce a tv commercial are no longer prohibitive for local and state candidates , who are turning more and more to the airwaves to reach voters . see how spending breaks down for this year '' and interest groups have spent $ 6.2 million on tv ads so far this year for state and local ballot measures . on the national level , the cost of issue-advocacy television ad spending was $ 270 million in the first nine months of this year . subjects ranged from the iraq war to telecommunications reform . television ads on health care alone total $ 60 million . cmag estimates more than $ 3 million of the $ 270 million spent to air issue-advocacy ads this year has gone for commercials in states and districts that are likely to have competitive house and senate races in 2008 . tracey said he thinks this is just the beginning of interest groups `` pivoting from legislative advocacy mode to political mode . '' `` what we expect to see between now and the end of the primaries , and through the general election , is groups will take a more aggressive stance on their advertising and actually target candidates , '' he said . with 17 democratic and republican candidates running for president , cmag predicts that more than $ 800 million will be spent on tv ads in the battle for the white house . up to now , the political commercials have been largely focused on the early states of iowa , new hampshire and south carolina . voters in some of the 20-plus states holding nominating contests on february 5 will start seeing ads in the coming months . former massachusetts gov. mitt romney leads all candidates in tv spending , having aired his commercials more than 11,000 times this year at a cost of nearly $ 8.6 million . this is a record for the number of airings at this point in a presidential election cycle . watch how romney is way ahead in ad spending '' in contrast , one of romney 's chief rivals for the gop nomination , former new york mayor rudy giuliani , has spent nothing on television ads , but giuliani leads in the national polls and is within striking distance of the lead in several state surveys . giuliani enjoys widespread national name recognition , while romney does not . in the race for the democratic nomination , illinois sen. barack obama has spent more than $ 2.3 million on television commercials , while new york sen. hillary clinton has spent $ 1 million less and leads in both national and early state polls . new mexico gov. bill richardson has probably benefited the most in the democratic contest from the $ 2 million he has invested in his television commercials . richardson 's humorous tv ads effectively stated his experience as a lawmaker , diplomat and executive , and positioned him as a solid second-tier candidate . romney used his $ 8.6 million in television ads to introduce himself as a social and fiscal conservative to republican voters . these voters might otherwise not know much about him other than that he was the governor of the traditionally liberal massachusetts . romney is leading polls in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire . further evidence of how romney 's television commercials have helped is in south carolina . an american research group poll of south carolina republicans in august showed romney registering at 9 percent with these influential primary voters . a month later , and with $ 350,000 worth of commercials aired in the two weeks leading up to the next poll , romney was up 17 percentage points . romney 's latest ad began airing friday in iowa , and in it he vows to stop iran from acquiring nuclear weapons , to boost the military by 100,000 people , to strengthen u.s. intelligence capabilities and to monitor calls into the u.s. from al qaeda . all of these issues should play well with conservatives who participate in the iowa caucuses . while only a handful of democratic candidates and romney have used the airwaves until now , tracey said he expects this to change . `` before the end of october , i suspect all the frontrunner candidates will be on the air , '' tracey said . `` as we get closer to primary day , the frontrunners will be joined by all the candidates in the race who are taking their last , best shot . '' in the fight for congress , cmag predicts that as much as $ 639 million could be spent on television advertising . democrats control the house and senate . tracey noted that cmag 's 2008 election cycle forecast does not take into account unforeseen events such as former florida rep. mark foley 's house page scandal or the september 11 terrorist attacks . `` politics is completely beholden to events , '' he said . `` events will ultimately determine how much is spent , where and when . '' what television advertising challenges do candidates and interest groups face in the coming months ? `` chances are , just as what happened in 2006 , voters will be numb after watching hundred and hundreds of ads , '' said stuart rothenberg , editor of the non-partisan rothenberg political report . `` the sheer number of ads probably dilutes their importance . after a while , the ads just become lots of chatter and an ad will have to be really good to cut through the noise .

'' patil won about two thirds of the electoral college votes . there had never been any doubt she would win , given support from the ruling coalition . the governor of the northwestern desert state of rajasthan , she emerged on the national stage when the congress-led coalition and its communist allies failed to agree on a joint candidate . `` this is a very special moment for us women , and men of course , in our country because for the first time we have a woman being elected president of india , '' congress party leader sonia gandhi , india 's most powerful politician , said . supporters hoped patil 's candidacy would help bring issues that plague women in india , like dowry-related violence , into the public spotlight . a woman is murdered , raped or abused every three minutes on average in india . her presidency also reflects the growing power of some women in india , where an increasing number are taking part in the workforce and in schools and hold senior positions in corporations . after the results , patil supporters took to the streets , singing and dancing as others lit fire crackers and beat large brass drums . india has had a number of female icons in the past -- most famously sonia gandhi 's mother-in-law , indira , who was one of the world 's first female prime ministers in 1966 . but hope patil 's presidency would spark only positive talk about women 's influence in india evaporated when it emerged the bank for women she helped established was closed in 2003 because of bad debts and amid accusations of financial irregularities . the employees ' union has taken patil and others to court , claiming loans meant for poor women were instead given to her brother and other relatives and not returned . she was also accused of trying to shield her brother in a murder inquiry . prime minister manmohan singh , who has dismissed accusations against her as `` mud-slinging '' , said on saturday her victory was `` a vote against the politics of divisiveness '' . `` all the allegations against me are motivated and have already been answered , '' patil said in a statement last week . her campaign was marked by other mishaps as well . she managed to offend many minority muslims , and anger some historians , by saying indian women first veiled their heads as protection against 16th century muslim invaders . then she dismayed modern india by claiming she had experienced a `` divine premonition '' that she was destined for higher office from a long dead spiritual guru . critics also dug up a comment she was said to have made as maharashtra 's health minister in 1975 , saying people with hereditary diseases should be sterilized . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .
39	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- explorer dennis schmitt found an island nearly two years ago near greenland . fishermen pass by greenland 's ilulissat fjord in this september 2004 picture . such a discovery would usually elicit curiosity , even wonder perhaps , but it evoked mixed feelings for the explorer . the island was once thought to be a peninsula attached to greenland by an ice shelf or a glacier . but such a large amount of ice melted , it revealed the distinct island . `` i very quickly realized two things , '' he told cnn 's anderson cooper during a visit to the island earlier this year . `` one -lsb- was -rsb- that this was going to be significant because it was going to be an example of climate change . '' `` the other thing was that it meant it was really happening . it was n't a joke . it was n't just statistics . it was really happening . '' he calls his discovery warming island . many climatologists and scientists say arctic ice melt and other changes in the earth 's climate are the result of an increase in the world 's temperature , a trend widely called global warming . many global warming experts say the phenomenon , if unchecked , is capable of altering the world 's climate and geography . in the worst-case scenario , experts say oceans could rise to overwhelming and catastrophic levels , flooding cities and altering seashores . other scientists and observers , a minority compared to those who believe the warming trend is something ominous , say it is simply the latest shift in the cyclical patterns of a planet 's life . most of the scientific community believes that some warming is occurring across the globe and through some layers of the atmosphere . but why it is occurring and what that means for the future is scientifically and politically contentious . the earth 's temperature averages about 60 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- about 16 degrees celsius -rrb- . the average surface temperature has warmed one degree fahrenheit -lrb- 0.6 degrees celsius -rrb- during the last century , according to the national research council . the temperatures were relatively unchanged from 1880 to 1910 , according to the u.s. environmental protection agency . they rose till about 1945 , cooled until about 1975 and have risen steadily to present day . there are several possible reasons for the warming , scientists say . a change in the earth 's orbit or the intensity of the sun 's radiation could change , triggering warming or cooling . the reason most cited -- by scientists and scientific organizations -- for the current warming trend is an increase in the concentrations of greenhouse gases , which are in the atmosphere naturally and help keep the planet 's temperature at a comfortable level . the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , for instance , has increased by 35 percent since the dawn of the industrial age , according to the united nations ' intergovernmental panel on climate change , commonly referred to as the ipcc . the presence of methane is now 151 percent above pre-industrial levels , but the rate of increase has slowed in recent decades , according to the epa . meanwhile , nitrous oxide increased by about 18 percent during the past 200 years . many scientists and experts who have studied global warming believe the increase is primarily the result of human activities , like the burning of fossil fuels , emissions from vehicles and the clearing of forests . `` for the last 30 years , there 's no way there 's anything natural that can explain it , '' stephen schneider , a professor of environmental studies at stanford university in california , said . `` a vast bulk of the knowledgeable and honest community ... will say the science is settled and humans are at least a majority of the reason behind the warming , '' he added . many scientific organizations share schneider 's view , ranging from the national academies of the countries that comprise the g8 to the national research council , the american meteorological society and the american geophysical union . but there are those who do not share his view , and among the skeptics is richard lindzen , a professor of atmospheric sciences at the massachusetts institute of technology . `` we 've suddenly taken to reading tea leaves , '' he said . `` when we saw cooling from 1940 to 1970 , we were proclaiming global cooling . since then , there 's been a few tenths of global warming , so we 're proclaiming global warming . '' he believes the current warming trend is the result of natural variability , where a planet goes through phases of warming and cooling and the human contribution to it is minimal . `` the earth is always getting colder and warmer , '' he said . `` it 's always changing . in fact , this is true of any fluid-covered planet . '' asked about glacial melt , which many observers point to as evidence of global warming , lindzen said the way glaciers change and move are phenomena largely unexplained . `` we do n't know why , but it 's perfectly clear that glaciers change even though the temperature is cooling at the place that they 've occurred , '' he said . `` what we 're doing is cherry picking any event that occurs and then saying that 's occurring due to global warming . '' yet , for schneider , it is a cause for concern and alarm . `` we 're already in serious melt , nobody can explain it . the models do n't predict it , '' he said . `` we do n't know what 's going on up there . all we know is that we could be triggering something really nasty . '' the greatest point of contention is the possible implications for future political and economic policies for the world 's nations . the ipcc in february 2007 projected that if carbon dioxide levels doubled relative to pre-industrial levels , temperatures could rise between 3.6 to 8.1 degrees fahrenheit -lrb- 2 to 4.5 degrees celsius -rrb- by 2100 . the lower end of the range could cause more intense hurricanes , droughts , wildfires and flooding , schneider said . the higher end could lead to the catastrophes commonly associated with the visions of hollywood filmmakers . uncertainties , however , plague such forecasts , which are based on computer simulations and models . the models contemplate factors associated with how the atmosphere , oceans and continents interact , all natural elements that have unpredictability intrinsic to them . `` exactly how much it 's going to warm up , we do n't know , '' schneider said . `` that it 's going to warm up ? i 'd bet anything on that .

40	abeche , chad -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- most of the 103 children that a french charity attempted to take to france from chad for adoption are neither sudanese nor orphans , three international aid agencies reported on thursday . hundreds of women protest child trafficking and shout anti-french slogans wednesday in abeche , chad . six members of zoe 's ark were arrested last week as they tried to put the children on a plane to france , where the charity said host families were waiting to take the children in . three french journalists , a seven-member spanish flight crew and one belgian were also arrested . representatives of the journalists and flight crew said they were unaware of problems with zoe 's ark and thought they were on a humanitarian mission . chadian president idriss deby hopes the journalists and the flight crew will be freed , his chief of staff , mahamat hissene , said thursday . the president would legally be able to intervene in the case if it is transferred from a judge in the eastern city of abeche , where the children were taken , to a judge in n'djamena , the capital , hissene said . the transfer will take place monday , according to media reports . the international red cross committee , the u.n. high commissioner for refugees and unicef said most of the children were living with their families before zoe 's ark took them . the charity said the children were sudanese orphans that it was trying to rescue from a war-torn nation . the agencies said most of the children also probably come from chadian villages along chad 's border with sudan . the children have been living in an orphanage in abeche while authorities and aid agencies try to determine their identities . watch a report on whether the children are orphans '' chadian authorities immediately accused the charity of kidnapping the children and concealing their identities . chad 's interior minister said zoe 's ark dressed the children in bandages and fake intravenous drips to make them look like refugees who needed medical help . the charity workers and journalists have been charged with kidnapping and extortion and could face 20 years of hard labor if convicted . the spaniards and belgian are charged with complicity . the spanish flight crew is innocent and should be released , a company executive said thursday . `` we thought we were doing a humanitarian transport , '' said antoni cajal , sales director of spain 's gir jet charter firm . `` if an ngo -lsb- nongovernmental organization -rsb- has done something wrong , it 's impossible for us to know . '' spain 's foreign ministry has publicly expressed its disagreement with the charges and has dispatched top diplomats to chad to try to win the group 's release . over the weekend , the captain appealed urgently to be rescued , fearing the crew could be harmed or killed , cajal said . but the four women and three men are in good condition in custody , cajal said , based on his conversations with a spanish consular official who came from cameroon to chad and has been able to visit them . the detention is the first problem of its kind for the company , which hopes government negotiations can resolve the issue , cajal said . on its web site , zoe 's ark describes itself as a nonprofit organization based in paris that sends teams of physicians , nurses , firefighters and other specialists to care for children in war zones and place them with families in france , who then apply for asylum on their behalf . the red cross , unhcr and unicef said the 21 girls and 82 boys range in age from about 1 year to about 10 , and they are healthy . the agencies said they have been interviewing the children individually to determine their backgrounds . `` so far , the interviews carried out with the children -- some of whom could not provide any information due to their young age -- led to the preliminary conclusion that probably 85 come from chadian villages near the cities of adre and tine along the chadian-sudanese border , '' the agencies said . `` ninety-one children said they had been living with their family , consisting of at least one adult they considered to be their parent , '' the agencies said , adding that interviews with the remaining 12 children were ongoing . the agencies called their investigation painstaking and challenging because of the number of children , their youth and the situation in the region . other french charities earlier had questioned whether zoe 's ark could legally arrange adoption of children from darfur , and contacted french authorities , according to french newspapers and the associated press . french authorities have reacted angrily to the zoe 's ark trip , calling the group 's actions `` illegal and irresponsible . '' the french foreign ministry has said the dispute will not affect france 's participation in a european peacekeeping force due to be deployed along the border between chad and sudan . in response to the dispute in chad , the republic of congo said late wednesday it was suspending all international adoptions , the associated press reported . reporters without borders said it will work for the release of the three journalists arrested in chad . the organization said photographers marc garmirian of the capa news agency and jean-daniel guillou of the synchro x agency were on assignment for their news organizations and were not part of the charity 's efforts . the third journalist , marie-agnes peleran of the tv station france 3 miditerranee , was traveling with the group in a personal capacity , though she carried a camera from her station , reporters without borders said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's al goodman contributed to this report . copyright 2007 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .
41	san diego , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- more than 100 homes in an upscale san diego community were evacuated after a landslide about 60 yards wide pulled the earth from beneath a three-lane road and some of the multimillion-dollar homes that adorn it . gina yarbrough sent this picture of the road that collapsed in wednesday 's landslide . mayor jerry sanders declared a state of emergency , asking california and the federal government to help the la jolla community recover from the wednesday landslide . as of thursday morning , he had already received offers of aid from legislators , the governor 's office and the white house , he said . officials warned for at least two weeks that the ground was shifting beneath the hillside community along soledad mountain road . holes were drilled into the unsettled hillside to investigate the cause and magnitude of the shift , which earlier ruptured a water line , and according to some media reports , began cracking soledad mountain road in july . on wednesday , a 20-foot-deep chasm opened beneath the road and homes . holli weld told san diego 's kgtv that she was walking her son to preschool when the street collapsed . watch a resident recall how he had to grab his dogs and run '' `` the street was sinking before our eyes , '' she said . authorities told kgtv that most residents were at work and only seven people were in their homes when the landslide occurred . evacuated homeowner russell moore told cnn he remembers hearing the earth `` groan '' in what he called a `` slow avalanche .

47	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- after weeks of controversy over michael mukasey 's views on waterboarding , the senate late thursday approved the former judge 's nomination for attorney general by a 53-40 vote . waterboarding threatened to derail the approval of president bush 's nominee to lead the justice department . president bush nominated mukasey to replace longtime ally alberto gonzales , who resigned in september . the nomination had been considered at risk after a number of democratic senators opposed mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president 's power to order electronic surveillance . mukasey , a former federal judge in new york , told senators he considers waterboarding `` repugnant , '' but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture , which u.s. and international law bans . waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning . mukasey 's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key democrats on the senate judiciary committee -- sens. dianne feinstein of california and chuck schumer of new york -- said they would vote in favor of mukasey despite the controversy . `` the department of justice , once the crown jewel among government institutions , is adrift and rudderless , '' schumer said tuesday -- the same day the committee voted 11-8 to send mukasey 's nomination to the senate floor . `` it desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and i believe judge mukasey is that person . '' schumer said that in a meeting friday the nominee said that congress would be within its rights to pass a law that bans waterboarding across all government agencies and that the president `` would have absolutely no legal authority to ignore '' it . schumer said he believed mukasey would be more likely to find waterboarding illegal than an interim attorney general . `` indeed , his written answers to our notices have demonstrated more openness to ending the practices we abhor than either of this president 's previous attorney general nominees have . '' but mukasey 's pledge to enforce such a law rang hollow with sen. patrick leahy , d-vermont , the judiciary committee 's chairman . `` some have sought to find comfort in judge mukasey 's personal assurance that he would enforce a future , new law against waterboarding if this congress were to pass one , '' leahy said tuesday . `` unsaid , of course , is the fact that any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this president . '' however , the committee 's ranking republican , sen. arlen specter of pennsylvania , said he believed mukasey would enforce a law banning waterboarding . `` he could have said a lot of things which would have given me more assurances , '' specter said earlier . `` but he is intelligent ; he 's really learned in the law . he 's strong , ethical , honest beyond any question . he 's not an intimate of the president . '' a majority of americans consider waterboarding a form of torture , but some of those say it 's ok for the u.s. government to use the technique , according to a poll released tuesday . asked whether they think waterboarding is a form of torture , more than two-thirds of respondents , or 69 percent , said yes ; 29 percent said no . asked whether they think the u.s. government should be allowed to use the procedure to try to get information from suspected terrorists , 58 percent said no ; 40 percent said yes . the cnn/opinion research corp. telephone poll of 1,024 american adults was carried out over the weekend and had a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points . e-mail to a friend .
48	mogadishu , somalia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- an enraged crowd dragged the body of an ethiopian soldier through the streets of somalia 's capital thursday after gun battles with islamic insurgents killed 19 people , witnesses reported . in a brutal echo of a 1993 battle involving somali militias in which the bodies of u.s. troops were dragged through the streets , crowds thursday shouted `` god is great '' as they pulled the bruised , bullet-riddled corpse through a dusty mogadishu neighborhood . the body was bound hand and foot with wire and wrapped in a sheet of plastic when insurgents pulled it out of a car and left it with the crowd in the northern mogadishu neighborhood of suqa holaha , witnesses reported . nine ethiopians are reportedly part of the 19 dead . another battle broke out on the city 's south side thursday morning between ethiopian troops and insurgents armed with heavy machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades . the fighting drove hundreds more people from their homes , on top of the tens of thousands aid agencies say have fled in recent weeks . `` ethiopians will launch violent attacks on us , for some of their comrades have been killed today , '' said rahma nor omar , an elderly woman in the capital . `` they will be like wounded animals . '' witnesses put the death toll from the day 's clashes at 19 , including ethiopian troops , insurgents and civilians . ethiopian troops arrived in somalia in december 2006 to help a weak somali government drive the islamic courts union out of mogadishu and restore a u.n.-backed transitional government after a decade and a half of near-anarchy . the islamists responded by launching an insurgency against somali government and ethiopian troops that has lasted nearly a year . the united states accused the icu of harboring suspected al qaeda figures , including three men wanted in the 1998 bombings of u.s. embassies in tanzania and kenya , and raised no objections to ethiopian presence in somalia . washington has long been concerned that somalia could turn into a safe haven for terrorists , but icu leaders denied harboring al qaeda suspects . e-mail to a friend .
49	bolingbrook , illinois -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the disappearance of a suburban chicago police sergeant 's wife is now being treated as a potential homicide , and her husband is a suspect , authorities said friday . stacy peterson , 23 , has been missing from her suburban chicago home since october 28 . in another development , a judge signed an order to exhume the body of drew peterson 's third wife , who was found drowned in a bathtub in 2004 , said will county state attorney james glasgow . peterson , 53 , said he last spoke to 23-year-old stacy peterson -- his fourth wife -- the night of october 28 . drew peterson initially told the media he believed his wife ran off with another man , but he has n't repeated that accusation . cnn has been unable to contact drew peterson for comment . the couple have been married four years and have two children , who have been interviewed for the investigation , glasgow said . drew peterson also has older children from a previous marriage . investigators have twice searched the couple 's home and vehicles , and removed several items , including computers , said illinois state police capt. carl dobrich . drew peterson allowed a limited search on the night his wife was reported missing , but investigators were not allowed to look throughout the entire house and were given access to only one of the vehicles at that time , dobrich said . `` early on , we looked at this as a missing persons case , but also believed strongly ... it was strongly starting to look at drew peterson as being a person of interest , '' dobrich said . `` i would say that right now , drew peterson has gone from being a person of interest to being a suspect . '' new information turned up during the investigation also raised questions about the death of peterson 's third wife , kathleen savio , which was ruled an accident by a coroner 's jury , glasgow said . `` there are strong indications that it was a homicide , '' he said . `` that 's why we are doing the exhumation , because there are tests that need to be done that were n't done during the first autopsy . '' watch why authorities want to exhume the body '' glasgow cited abrasions on savio 's body and a gash on her head that could not be readily explained . `` our main thrust is to determine whether or not it was a homicide , and as we do that , we will see if there is any evidence that implicates anyone , '' he said . glasgow , who was not state attorney at the time of savio 's death , said he reviewed the case file before deciding to reopen the case . `` with 29 years of experience , there was no doubt in my mind it was n't an accident , '' he said . `` that was clear . '' in 2002 , savio was charged once with battery and once with domestic battery against her husband , but was found not guilty at trial , glasgow said . another time , she tried to bring domestic battery charges against peterson , but no charges were ever filed . savio 's sister , sue doman , said savio expressed fear of drew peterson . `` she told me all the time , ` he 's gon na kill me . it 's gon na look like an accident , ' '' doman said . doman said she did n't believe her sister could have died in the way the investigation concluded . `` i do n't understand accidental drowning . you just do n't drown in the bathtub , especially a small whirlpool . you just do n't do that , '' she said . meanwhile , friends and family of stacy peterson said she expressed concerns about her husband . a friend , steve cesare , has told cnn he received e-mail from her describing her relationship as abusive . the woman 's aunt , candace aikin , of el monte , california , said stacy peterson confided in her that there were problems during a visit to the peterson home in suburban chicago last month . `` she said that she was afraid because he was following her around 24/7 , even inside the house , '' aikin said . `` he was very obsessed and stalking her , even inside her house . she was very , very full of stress and just not happy in her marriage at all , '' aikin said . e-mail to a friend .
50	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- china has suspended exports of the aqua dots toys contaminated with a chemical that can convert to a powerful `` date rape '' drug , the state-run xinhua news agency reported saturday . the toys have caused some children who swallowed the craft toys to vomit and lose consciousness . china suspended exports of the aqua dots toys that contain a chemical that converts into a `` date rape '' drug . the agency said that the general administration of quality supervision , inspection , and quarantine -lrb- aqsiq -rrb- has ordered an investigation by quality control agencies and will release results as soon as they are available . the aqsiq did not reveal the name of the toys ' producer , xinhua said . u.s. safety officials voluntarily recalled about 4.2 million of the chinese-made toys wednesday . scientists have found the highly popular holiday toy contains a chemical that , once metabolized , converts into the toxic `` date rape '' drug ghb -lrb- gamma-hydroxy butyrate -rrb- , scott wolfson , a spokesman with the u.s. consumer product safety commission -lrb- cpsc -rrb- , told cnn . `` children who swallow the beads can become comatose , develop respiratory depression or have seizures , '' a cpsc statement warned . the arts-and-craft beads , which have been selling since april at major u.s. retail stores under the name `` aqua dots , '' have also been distributed in australia under the name `` bindeez beads . '' the bindeez toys were recalled tuesday by melbourne-based moose enterprise pty. ltd. after three children in australia swallowed large quantities of the beads and were hospitalized . `` i was so frightened because i thought she was n't going to make it , '' heather lehane told cnn affiliate network 7 of her 10-year-old daughter , charlotte , who was hospitalized in australia after ingesting some of the beads . in the united states , the washington-based safety commission said it has in recent days received two reports detailing the severe effects of the digested beads , which are part of a craft kit aimed at kids 4 years and older . the cpsc said a boy nearly 2 years old `` swallowed several dozen beads . he became dizzy and vomited several times before slipping into a comatose state for a period of time . '' the commission said the toddler was hospitalized and has since `` fully recovered . '' the second incident involved a child who vomited , fell into a coma and was hospitalized for five days . it was not immediately clear whether the child had made a full recovery . toronto-based toy distributor spin master ltd. stopped shipping the aqua dots toys and asked retailers to pull them off their shelves , where they were previously sold for $ 17 to $ 30 . anyone with aqua dots at home should return the product to the company , cpsc spokeswoman julie vallese said . the toy had been named toy of the year in australia and recently crested wal-mart 's list of top 12 christmas toys . wal-mart on thursday listed the toys on its web site as `` out of stock online '' and had removed them from their top toy list as well . this latest recall is part of a larger batch of recalls of chinese-made toys that have swept across the country . last month alone , u.s. government safety officials and retailers voluntarily recalled at least 69,000 chinese-made toys over concerns of excessive amounts of lead paint , which can cause hazardous lead poisoning . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's janine brady , jason carroll , laura dolan , julie o'neill and leslie wiggins contributed to this report .
51	johannesburg , south africa -- south african fast bowler dale steyn took a career-best five for 34 as the proteas took a tight grip on the first test against new zealand in johannesburg . steyn 's career-best 5-34 was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests . new zealand were bowled out for 118 in reply to south africa 's 226 and the home side piled on the agony by reaching 179 for two in their second innings . hashim amla and jacques kallis shared an unbeaten stand of 159 as south africa stretched their lead to 287 . south africa 's bowlers excelled to bring their side back into the game after their disappointing first innings . they snapped up five wickets in the morning session when the kiwis could only muster 56 runs . former new zealand captain stephen fleming made 40 but the next best score was new cap ross taylor 's 15 . fleming was struck on the right forearm by steyn and did not field during the afternoon . coach john bracewell said he had gone for precautionary x-rays but there was only bruising . new zealand , 41 for two overnight , lost nightwatchman shane bond , bowled by a steyn yorker , before makhaya ntini claimed the crucial wicket of fleming , who was well caught by ab de villiers diving to his left at third slip . scott styris and taylor scraped 19 runs in 10 overs before more wickets tumbled . steyn 's figures bettered his previous best of five for 47 against the same opponents at centurion two seasons ago . it was his fourth five-wicket haul in 14 tests . ntini took three for 47 and kallis two for 11 . south africa made an uncertain start to their second innings with openers herschelle gibbs and captain graeme smith out cheaply , but amla and kallis blunted the attack and then took charge . they batted together for 205 minutes , amla facing 230 balls and hitting 13 boundaries in his 85 while kallis hit 12 fours off 122 deliveries in reaching 76 . the kiwis were left to regret brendon mccullum 's failure to hold a chance from amla off shane bond , when the batsman had only scored two . `` the ball was hard and new and we were trying to get momentum . it cost us a lot , '' said coach john bracewell . e-mail to a friend .

'' she repeats several times , making sure the message is clear and waving away jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion . dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground . harb wants the cnn crew to see how many iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating . this school year , she says , 145 students are iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 iraqi children on a waiting list . watch iraqi girls describe a long way from home '' the reason behind the jump in the number of iraqis at the school is a new government policy : for the first time since the start of the iraq war , jordan is allowing all iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools . simply , this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked . the move is cementing a massive population shift in the middle east . more than 2.2 million iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland , most of them seeking refuge in neighboring jordan and syria , according to humanitarian officials . jordanian minister of education khalid touqan says he expects jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 iraqi students this year . that 's more than double the number of iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago . harb , on the front line of the phenomenon , says the influx is putting a strain on her school . even with some u.n. and u.s. aid to jordan , there 's still not enough money . `` we need more teachers here , more resources , more buildings , more chairs for all iraqi students and our students , '' she says . in a nearby neighborhood , in the study room of the ahmed toukan school for boys , a handful of iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home . seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth , the boys tell stories of horror and displacement . eighteen-year-old qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to jordan to try to live a normal life . matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare , he repeats the number : `` five members . '' most of the boys and young men from iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation , but also their entry into the workforce . all say , though , that they feel lucky to have gotten out , even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move , ready to live far from home and away from loved ones . `` it 's not strange for me to be in the middle of people i do n't know , '' says eleventh grader ziad tarek al shamsi . `` i had friends in iraq when i was small , i left them . in america , i left them . i came here , i left them . '' he pauses : `` but you have to miss your country . '' the united nations high commissioner for refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age iraqi children are in jordan . many of them are enrolled in private institutions . but as families run out of money they had when they left iraq , they turn to public schools . even so , more than a month into the new academic year , fewer iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year . according to the charity save the children , 21,000 iraqi children have so far enrolled in jordanian classrooms . as a result , the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for iraqi families . the lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees ' fears of being identified through their children 's school records . regardless of what the final number will be this year , the population shift in the middle east is , according to unhcr head antonio guterres , the largest urban refugee situation in the world . iraqi families are changing the social fabric of jordanian society . about 10 percent of jordan 's population is now made up of iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them . the schoolchildren are living examples of how the iraq war may permanently change the middle east . `` iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education , '' says touqan , the education minister . `` we will not run a parallel system of education .

57	amman , jordan -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- in the sunbathed schoolyard of the shmisani institute for girls in amman , jordan , principal sanaa abu harb makes an announcement over the speaker system . iraqi students at the shmisani school in amman gather around a teacher . one in 5 students there is iraqi . `` all iraqi girls come outside now . all iraqi girls . iraqi girls only ! '' she repeats several times , making sure the message is clear and waving away jordanian pupils attracted by the commotion . dozens of girls in green apron-like uniforms pour out into the courtyard and cluster on the top level of a stone staircase overlooking a concrete playground . harb wants the cnn crew to see how many iraqi refugee girls her school is accommodating . this school year , she says , 145 students are iraqi -- roughly 20 percent of the students at this state-funded institution -- with another 40 iraqi children on a waiting list . watch iraqi girls describe a long way from home '' the reason behind the jump in the number of iraqis at the school is a new government policy : for the first time since the start of the iraq war , jordan is allowing all iraqi children -- regardless of refugee status -- to enroll in state-funded schools . simply , this means that even illegal refugees with no paperwork can send their kids to school with no questions asked . the move is cementing a massive population shift in the middle east . more than 2.2 million iraqis have fled the violence in their homeland , most of them seeking refuge in neighboring jordan and syria , according to humanitarian officials . jordanian minister of education khalid touqan says he expects jordan to accommodate 40,000 to 50,000 iraqi students this year . that 's more than double the number of iraqi children enrolled in public school two years ago . harb , on the front line of the phenomenon , says the influx is putting a strain on her school . even with some u.n. and u.s. aid to jordan , there 's still not enough money . `` we need more teachers here , more resources , more buildings , more chairs for all iraqi students and our students , '' she says . in a nearby neighborhood , in the study room of the ahmed toukan school for boys , a handful of iraqi kids talk of their experience living far from home . seated at a rectangular table covered with a red and white tablecloth , the boys tell stories of horror and displacement . eighteen-year-old qutaiba lost five immediate family members before moving to jordan to try to live a normal life . matter-of-factly and with a straight-ahead stare , he repeats the number : `` five members . '' most of the boys and young men from iraq have missed several years of school -- up to a four-year educational gap that will delay not only their high school graduation , but also their entry into the workforce . all say , though , that they feel lucky to have gotten out , even if the violence in their country means always having to be on the move , ready to live far from home and away from loved ones . `` it 's not strange for me to be in the middle of people i do n't know , '' says eleventh grader ziad tarek al shamsi . `` i had friends in iraq when i was small , i left them . in america , i left them . i came here , i left them . '' he pauses : `` but you have to miss your country . '' the united nations high commissioner for refugees estimates up to 250,000 school-age iraqi children are in jordan . many of them are enrolled in private institutions . but as families run out of money they had when they left iraq , they turn to public schools . even so , more than a month into the new academic year , fewer iraqi families than first anticipated enrolled their kids in schools this year . according to the charity save the children , 21,000 iraqi children have so far enrolled in jordanian classrooms . as a result , the government extended the deadline for student applications and cut down on the required paperwork for iraqi families . the lower registration numbers were attributed in part to illegal refugees ' fears of being identified through their children 's school records . regardless of what the final number will be this year , the population shift in the middle east is , according to unhcr head antonio guterres , the largest urban refugee situation in the world . iraqi families are changing the social fabric of jordanian society . about 10 percent of jordan 's population is now made up of iraqi refugees -- the estimates range from 500,000 to 750,000 of them . the schoolchildren are living examples of how the iraq war may permanently change the middle east . `` iraqi children will be incorporated and integrated within our mainstream line of education , '' says touqan , the education minister . `` we will not run a parallel system of education .

58	patuakhali , bangladesh -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- survivors of a storm that killed more than 3,000 people in the impoverished nation of bangladesh grieved and buried their loved ones monday as they waited for aid to arrive . villagers grieve in patargata , around 125 miles south of dhaka , capital of bangladesh , monday . the number of dead killed from cyclone sidr -- now at 3,114 -- is expected to rise yet further as the south asian nation continues to assess the damage . the bangladesh red crescent fears the death toll could be 5,000 -- perhaps even reaching as high as 10,000 . in the fishing village of galachipa , in patuakhali district , dhalan mridha was grieving for family members who died in the cyclone after ignoring an alert issued by authorities . `` nothing is going to happen . that was our first thought and we went to bed . just before midnight the winds came like hundreds of demons . our small hut was swept away like a piece of paper , and we all ran for shelter , '' mridha , a 45-year-old farm worker , told the associated press . on the way to a shelter , mridha lost contact with his wife , mother and two children . the next morning he found their bodies . the category 4 cyclone raked bangladesh 's southwest coast on thursday with maximum sustained winds of 241 km/h -lrb- 150 mph -rrb- , destroying fishermen 's hamlets and villages . thousands are still missing , while an estimated 280,000 others are unable to return to their homes which were wiped out by the storm . many grieving families are now burying loved ones in single graves as no male members are available to dig them . most houses in the region are made of flimsy materials such as bamboo and corrugated iron , and had no chance of withstanding the storm 's powerful winds . in addition , the storm-struck area is criss-crossed by a huge river delta which surged as sidr pushed through , wiping out many villages and littering the river 's shores with debris . watch as people are left to fend for themselves '' low-lying bangladesh is already prone to flooding which has wiped out the country 's rice production -- a major food staple for the impoverished country . improved warning systems and shelters have kept the number of deaths far lower than the disastrous cyclones in the region of 1970 and 1991 , when the tolls were in the hundreds of thousands . bangladesh president iajuddin ahmed visited the devastated region sunday , handing out some aid to the crowds of people before members of the international media . it was seen largely a token effort as hundreds were left empty-handed and furious . security officials struggled to hold back the crowd . see dramatic photos of storm survivors '' sidr has already ruined bangladesh 's rice harvest , but the international community is rallying to make sure the country does not suffer as acutely as it has in the past . nearly a million people died after massive floods wiped out the country 's rice production in 1974 . international aid organizations promised initial packages of $ 25 million during a meeting with bangladesh agencies monday , the u.n. 's world food program said . the united states has offered more than $ 2 million as an initial contribution for emergency relief , and sent two u.s. navy carriers to help in recovery operations . in addition , the u.s. agency for international development -lrb- usaid -rrb- is airlifting in relief supplies and an 18-person department of defense medical team is in bangladesh helping the estimated 15,000 injured by the storm . bangladesh 's government held an emergency cabinet meeting saturday to assess the disaster and discuss recovery issues , bangladeshi government spokesman fahim munaim told cnn . officials fear the scope of the destruction may be much more extensive since there are remote areas where conditions can not yet be determined . munaim said nearly a third of bangladesh 's 64 districts were affected by the cyclone , most of those along the southern coast . the bangladeshi military is working to provide shelter for the many people who have been displaced . international aid groups -- including save the children , world vision , and the red crescent , which already have offices in bangladesh -- are deploying resources to the cyclone-stricken region but -- like the government -- they have found it nearly impossible to reach the more remote areas to assess conditions . roads to remote areas are either blocked by massive trees fallen by the storm , or so severely damaged that it is impossible for vehicles to use . clearing could take weeks in the remote areas because it must be done by hand -- there are no chainsaws and modern machinery to speed up the process . along the broken road that leads into kolapara , the body of an 8-year-old girl called rummie was carefully carried away for burial . overwhelmed with sadness , her mother khadija was steadied by a relative . `` i am feeling too much pain in my heart , '' she said . `` i have lost my daughter , so i am a victim of the cyclone as well .

59	glasgow , scotland -- world champions italy clinched qualification for euro 2008 after goals in the first and last minutes gave them a pulsating 2-1 victory at hampden park -- killing off scotland 's hopes of reaching the finals . luca toni celebrates his early goal as italy won 2-1 in scotland to clinch qualification from group b. luca toni shot italy in front but scotland recovered to dominate and barry ferguson bundled home a 65th-minute leveller . however , christian panucci headed an injury-time winner after a controversial decision to award italy a free-kick . the result also means france have sealed qualification , along with italy , from group b without playing a game . in a match played in torrential rain , italy enjoyed the best possible start by taking the lead after just 70 seconds . gianluca zambrotta spotted antonio di natale unmarked in the box , and picked him out with a throw-in as scotland were caught napping . di natale swept the ball into the path of toni who delicately flicked into the top left corner from six meters out . the home side almost conceded a second goal 60 seconds later . this time , toni turned provider and his cut-back was met by mauro camoranesi who fired over from close-range . toni then shrugged off two challenges before drawing a decent save from craig gordon with a well-struck effort that the goalkeeper did well to block at the near post . at the other end , scotland were denied the opportunity to haul themselves back into the match when a thunderous drive from lee mcculloch appeared to be handled by zambrotta inside the area but penalty claims were ignored . spurred on by a sense of injustice , the hosts cranked up the pressure on their visitors . ferguson fired over from a james mcfadden corner , before alan hutton nodded agonisingly wide of the upright following another perfect delivery from the everton man . scotland then produced some wonderful passing football , which culminated in a tight-angled drive from ferguson , but gianluigi buffon dived low to smother . then came another scare for the home side . gordon was forced to pull a save out of the top drawer to deny a point-blank effort from massimo ambrosini , before di natale rifled the rebound into the back of the net . the assistant referee raised his flag for offside but television replays suggested the official may have called it wrong . only last-gasp defending from the italians prevented the scots from grabbing a morale-boosting leveller on the stroke of half-time . david weir rose above everyone else in a packed box to meet ferguson 's corner and his header appeared to be heading for the top corner before andrea pirlo somehow managed to nod off the line . a free-kick in a dangerous area provided italy with the chance to start the second half as emphatically as they had started the first when paul hartley hauled down camoranesi just outside the box . pirlo seized on the chance and looped the ball over the wall but , despite a reputation as a dead-ball specialist , his effort was easily dealt with by gordon . instead , it was scotland who found the back of the net as hampden erupted with 65 minutes gone . mcfadden 's free-kick deflected into the path of mcculloch in front of goal . he was denied by buffon , but the rebound fell kindly to ferguson and the captain gratefully rifled home from close-range . with just over 15 minutes to go , scott brown was withdrawn for kenny miller as scotland went for broke . the derby striker quickly began to cause the italians problems and delivered a wonderful diagonal cross to the feet of mcfadden but he fired wide when it looked easier score . scotland 's impossible dream ended in the cruellest possible way when italy snatched a last minute goal to secure their own qualification for euro 2008 . hutton appeared to be barged over in front of the corner flag but the referee inexplicably awarded the free-kick the other way and panucci rose to meet pirlo 's cross and nod home the winner . italy coach roberto donadoni said : `` we knew it was going to be a physical match given the atmosphere . `` but through their character and desire , the lads were fantastic . they worked so hard , they deserve this . qualifying for euro 2008 is amazing . it 's something positive after all that happened last week -lrb- the death of the lazio fan -rrb- . '' captain fabio cannavaro : `` this was a victory won with the heart . it was difficult to play in this stadium , with that atmosphere it was like a cauldron . `` we played really well and managed to win . we showed once again that we are a strong and compact team and when we need to win we do everything to show that we are the world champions . `` in italy we play a high level of football , we 've won the champions league and the world cup but unfortunately at this moment we are being noticed for something else .

60	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- 1 . the spam ® museum . spam marks its 70th anniversary in 2007 which is also the chinese year of the pig . if the on-site `` wall of spam '' is any indication , a tour through the spam museum in austin , minnesota , is guaranteed fun for the whole canned-pork-loving family . spam 's parent company , hormel foods , opened the establishment in 2001 to the tune of almost 5,000 cans of spam . one of the main attractions is a scale model of a spam plant , where visitors can don white coats and hairnets while pretending to produce america 's favorite tinned meat . 2 . national museum of funeral history . it 's pretty hard to argue with the motto `` any day above ground is a good one . '' so goes the backhanded optimism of the national museum of funeral history , a houston facility that opened in 1992 . visitors are treated to exhibits that include a civil war embalming display and a replica of a turn-of-the-century casket factory . in addition , the museum boasts an exhibit of `` fantasy coffins '' designed by ghanaian artist kane quaye . these moribund masterpieces include a casket shaped like a chicken , a mercedes-benz , a shallot , and an outboard motor . according to quaye , his creations are based on the dreams and last wishes of his clients , which -- let 's be honest -- really makes you wonder about the guy buried in the shallot . 3 . the hobo museum . if you 're bumming around but looking for a good time , be sure to take a load off in britt , iowa , at the hobo museum , which details the history and culture of tramps . bear in mind , though , that the museum kind of , well , slacks on hours and is only open to the public during the annual hobo convention . luckily , tours can be arranged by appointment any time of year . of course , if you 're interested in the hobo convention , lodging is available all over the area , but it 's a safe bet that most of your compatriots will be resting their floppy hats at the `` hobo jungle , '' located by the railroad tracks . both the event and the museum are operated by the hobo foundation , which -- incidentally -- also oversees the nearby hobo cemetery , where those who have `` caught the westbound '' are laid to rest . 4 . the mütter museum . originally , the college of physicians of philadelphia erected the mütter museum as a creative way to inform medical students and practicing physicians about some of the more unusual medical phenomena . -lrb- you know , babies with two heads , that sort of thing . -rrb- . but today , it primarily serves as a popular spot for anyone interested in the grotesque . there , you 'll find the world 's largest colon , removed from a man who died -- not surprisingly -- of constipation . also on display : an ob-gyn instrument collection , thousands of fluid-preserved anatomical and pathological specimens , and a large wall dedicated entirely to swallowed objects . 5 . the barnum museum . what better way to honor `` greatest show on earth '' founder p.t. barnum than with a mediocre museum in bridgeport , connecticut ? some visitors will appreciate the museum 's ridiculously detailed miniature model of a five-ring circus . but only circus freaks -lrb- and by that we mean `` enthusiasts '' -rrb- will get a kick out of seeing a stale piece of cake from the wedding of barnum 's 40-inch-tall sidekick , general tom thumb . 6 . the conspiracy museum . there 's more than one theory about the assassination of john f. kennedy , so why not have more than one museum devoted to it as well ? most jfk buffs are familiar with the sixth floor museum housed in the former texas school book depository , which recounts all those boring `` mainstream '' details of the late president 's life leading up to his death at the hands of lee harvey oswald . but just down the street , the conspiracy museum offers fodder for those less apt to buy into the man 's propaganda . for the most part , the museum specializes in showings of the zapruder film and explanations of contrary assassination theories , including other gunmen on the grassy knoll and possible mafia involvement . 7 . the museum of questionable medical devices . take two trips to the museum of questionable medical devices and call us when you 've lost all faith in the medical profession . thanks to curator bob mccoy -lrb- who recently donated the collection to the science museum of minnesota -rrb- , those in search of history 's quack science can find what they 're looking for in the st. paul tourist attraction , whether it 's a collection of 19th-century phrenology machines or some 1970s breast enlargers . if you make the trip , be sure to check out the 1930s mcgregor rejuvenator . this clever device required patrons to enclose their bodies , sans head , in a large tube where they were pounded with magnetic and radio waves in attempts to reverse the aging process . 8 . cook 's natural science museum . what began as a training facility for cook 's pest control exterminators blossomed into one of the few museums in the country willing to tell the tale of the pest . at cook 's natural science museum in decatur , alabama , visitors can learn everything they ever wanted to know about rats , cockroaches , mice , spiders , and termites ... all for free . and while most people would rather step on the live specimens than learn about them , museum exhibits such as the crowd-pleasing pest of the month keep reeling in patrons . 9 . vent haven ventriloquist museum . so , what do you get when you combine the loneliness of a pet cemetery with the creepy flair of vaudeville ? the vent haven ventriloquist museum , of course -- where dummies go to die . the fort mitchell , kentucky , museum was the brainchild of the late william shakespeare berger , who founded the site as a home for retired wooden puppets . in fact , he collected figures from some of the country 's most famous ventriloquist acts . and with more than 700 dummies stacked from floor to ceiling , you 're bound to feel like you 're stuck inside a 1970s horror flick -- albeit a really good one . but sadly , when berger gave the tour , you could totally tell his mouth was moving . 10 . the trash museum . mom was n't kidding when she said one man 's trash is another man 's treasure . at the trash museum in hartford , connecticut , the connecticut resources recovery authority -lrb- crra -rrb- turns garbage into 6,500 square feet of pure recycling entertainment ! t . our the temple of trash or visit the old-fashioned town dump . and for your recycler-in-training , head across the state to the children 's garbage museum , where you can take an educational stroll through the giant compost pile , get a glimpse of the 1-ton trash-o-saurus , or enjoy the company of resident compost worms . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .

63	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- attacks are down 75 percent in recent months in a perilous stretch of neighborhoods in northeastern baghdad , prompting a u.s. military officer to proclaim monday that security there is `` dramatically improving . '' concerned citizens have helped troops improve security in parts of baghdad , a military official says . people line the streets , cars congest them , trash collectors and other city workers have returned , local leaders are holding community meetings again and `` markets have come back like gangbusters , '' said army col. don farris , commander of 2nd brigade combat team , 82nd airborne division . he added that the largely sunni al qaeda in iraq presence has been `` crushed '' since the beginning of may . however , there are still dangers , most notably the threats posed by iranian-backed shiite militants , farris said . speaking to pentagon reporters via video link from baghdad , farris cited several factors he said contributed to the improving security situation . among them is the `` surge , '' the additional u.s. troops deployed earlier this year . watch how old rivalries have been posing problems '' also helping improve the security situation are the cease-fire by radical shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr 's mehdi army and the development of a program that employs `` concerned local citizens '' to assist u.s. and iraqi forces , farris said . some of those citizens are members of local sunni `` awakening councils , '' comprised of former militants -- often armed -- who create neighborhood watch groups to root out the insurgent elements in an area . especially in the last six weeks , farris said , civic and religious leaders have seen outsiders operating in the area and troops have made arrests , two iranian operatives among them . `` from my foxhole , in our sector , it is working , '' he said of the improving security in the area . `` i can only speak to what i see in my sector and i am encouraged . '' farris ' sector -- which includes the sunni-dominated district of adhamiya and sadr city , the shiite slum where militants have demonstrated a strong presence -- has seen a `` remarkable turnaround , '' he said . many of the communities in his area have been wracked with sectarian warfare and terrorized by insurgents and death squads . despite improvements in the security situation , farris warned that `` we still have a lot of work to do '' because there does n't appear to be any sign that shiite extremists with links to iran are halting their activities . farris said troops also are still finding explosively formed penetrators , which are often delivered or manufactured by iran . nine such bombs were found in late october , he said . there are intelligence reports indicating weapons and money are still flowing into sadr city , he said . there are also problems returning refugees and displaced people to their homes in the area , farris said , because `` essential services '' like water and electricity are not yet up to snuff . though a `` trickle '' of families has returned home and many are asking when they can return , farris said he believes residents will return en masse only when basic services are in better shape . paul folmsbee , a state department provincial reconstruction team leader , said at the same news conference that his personnel was handling development issues involving law , governance , economic development and essential services . farris ' monday remarks echo a string of similar assertions made by u.s. and iraqi military officials over recent weeks . the military officials say they are seeing signs of sunni-shiite reconciliation . at a press conference earlier monday in baghdad , brig. gen. ed cardon , deputy commander for support of multi-national division-center , discussed a `` definite period of progress '' in his region on the southern baghdad outskirts . e-mail to a friend .

67	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- they say a lot of artistic expression is motivated by self-loathing . but not for these folks ! long before the material girl ordered papa to stop preaching , these six puffed-up virtuosos knew darn well how to strike a pose . alfred hitchcock did n't leave people in suspense about how he felt about actors . here 's to the creative types who managed to raise egotism to an art form . alfred hitchcock . hitchcock was , without question , one of the towering geniuses of cinema . and , like many greats , he was n't exactly the best collaborator . hitchcock was particularly trying for screenwriters , who felt he never properly credited them for their work . but he was notoriously hard on actors . he was once quoted as saying , `` actors are cattle '' -- a quip that stirred up a huge outcry -lrb- actors can be so touchy -rrb- . in response , he issued this correction : `` i have been misquoted . what i really said is , ` actors should be treated as cattle . ' '' although it began accidentally -lrb- when he was short an actor for the film `` the lodger '' -rrb- , hitchcock soon made it his egotistical trademark to appear in his own films , amassing a total of 37 cameos throughout his career . ayn rand . the egotist 's egotist , author ayn rand -lrb- born alissa zinovievna rosenbaum -rrb- is the patron saint of thinking you 're better than everybody else . her most famous novels , the fountainhead and atlas shrugged , are massive dramatizations of objectivism , her self-spun oscar-the-grouch philosophy for success . objectivism champions ego and accomplishment , shuns all religion as folly , and condemns any form of charity or altruism as counterproductive to society . rand 's novels often focus on protagonists -lrb- invariably men -rrb- who are shunned by others because of their genius , but then persevere over the foolishness of morons to prove said genius and emerge triumphant . not surprisingly , she saw humility as a weakness and regarded laughing at yourself as `` spitting in your own face . '' so , just how much did rand believe in her own philosophy ? let 's just say a lot . with signature modesty , she ranked herself as the philosophical equal of aristotle and thomas aquinas . orson welles . when you create a cinematic masterpiece such as `` citizen kane '' at the ripe old age of 25 , you 're bound to get a big head . but welles was convinced of his own importance much earlier than that . in fact , `` citizen kane '' might have been sparked by nothing more than a bruised ego . after all , it 's said he devised the film as a withering exposé of newspaper mogul william randolph hearst because hearst slighted welles at a dinner party . of course , after the unparalleled success of `` citizen kane , '' welles 's arrogant side did n't get any less subtle . do yourself a favor : track down a recording of welles ' outtakes for a tv commercial for frozen peas . you 'll hear everything you need to know about the filmmaker 's oversized ego . a classic quote goes : `` in the depths of your ignorance , what is it you want ? '' frank lloyd wright . as the brains behind the robie house , fallingwater , taliesin west , the guggenheim , and countless other design benchmarks , frank lloyd wright is arguably the genius of 20th-century architecture . and , boy , did he know it ! wright was notorious for believing he was superior to mere mortals . in fact , the architectural egomaniac frequently acted as though the rules -- even those of geography and climate -- did not apply to him . but when you 're wright , you 're right . in 1935 , department store magnate stanley marcus -lrb- of neiman-marcus fame -rrb- commissioned the architect to design his dallas home , but the project quickly went sour . wright 's avant-garde floor plan included `` sleeping porches '' that required his client to sleep outdoors year-round . in addition , marcus ' small bedroom `` cubicles '' came equipped with almost no closet space . when stanley respectfully explained that -lrb- a -rrb- temperatures during summer nights in dallas often exceed 80 degrees and -lrb- b -rrb- a high-fashion tastemaker might need bigger closets , wright threw a series of tantrums . fortunately for the voyeur in us all , said tantrums usually took place in letter form . preserved and occasionally displayed at the dallas museum of art , they make for delicious reading . salvador dalí . `` every morning when i awake , the greatest of joys is mine : that of being salvador dalí . '' yup , he actually said that . everything about the legendary surrealist painter -lrb- he of the melting clocks -rrb- -- from his whacked-out paintings to his curled-up mustache -- was designed to shock , destroy convention , cause scandal , and stir controversy . criticized for choosing to live under general franco 's fascist government in spain , dalí defended his position by stating that he did n't care about others so long as he could be king . not exactly a man of the people . if he was n't getting enough attention , he was known to walk the streets of new york city clanging a hand bell . of course , this is also the guy who once said , `` the thought of not being recognized -lsb- is -rsb- unbearable . '' need another telling quote ? `` at the age of 6 years , i wanted to be a chef . at the age of 7 , i wanted to be napoleon . my ambitions have continued to grow at the same rate ever since . '' apparently , so did his ego . al jolson . plenty of performers this side of gallagher have been labeled `` the world 's greatest entertainer . '' but al jolson really , really believed it . the vaudeville singer , actor , dancer , and comedian was born asa yoelson in seredzius , lithuania , in what was then part of imperial russia . as a performer , he was known for hijacking the action in the middle of shows , ad-libbing , or just stopping to talk to the audience . during a 1911 performance of the critically hated `` paris is a paradise for coons '' -lrb- title not edited for political correctness -rrb- , jolson stopped and asked the audience if they 'd rather hear him sing than see the rest of the play . the crowd roared with applause , and jolson ditched the whole program and took over . from that moment on , no one else could share the stage with him . unlike some of the egomaniacs on this list , however , jolson can be forgiven somewhat for his arrogance . according to most contemporary accounts , he actually was the greatest in the world . but , despite the enormity of his contributions to stage and screen , jolson 's legacy has become a political hot potato because of his use of stage blackface -lrb- considered highly offensive now , but pretty common at the time -rrb- . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .

'' the result is a boost for rising british star andy murray , who earlier kept alive his hopes of an unexpected place at the masters cup by winning his first match in paris and was expected to face djokovic . the 20-year-old , who has missed three months this season due to a wrist injury , beat jarkko nieminen of finland 7-6 -lrb- 7-5 -rrb- 6-3 to progress into the third round . the 15th seed is seeking to overtake tommy haas , who holds the eighth and final place ahead of the showpiece event in shanghai . murray , who trails the german by just three points , has not beaten djokovic in three meetings so far but he has never played his unseeded next opponent santoro . ninth seed haas , who has struggled with illness and injury this year , will play djokovic 's compatriot janko tipsarevic in the second round . murray , who won his second title this year at the st petersburg open last sunday , made a confident start against nieminen and showed little sign of the stiff back he suffered after a minor car crash on monday . he held his serve to love against a player who was beaten in the final of the swiss indoors event by roger federer last weekend , but then struggled for his best form as the first set went to a tiebreak . the scot was broken just one point after having a winner overturned following an on-court appeal , but he leveled immediately and then broke nieminen again to win a third successive game before serving out for victory . defending champin and fourth seed nikolay davydenko , one of six players to have already qualified for shanghai , beat argentina 's juan del potro 7-6 -lrb- 7-3 -rrb- 6-1 in his opening match on wednesday . the russian , fined for `` lack of effort '' after his defeat by croatian qualifier marian cilic in st petersburg , will next face marcos baghdatis of cyprus in round three after baghdatis shocked 13th seed ivan ljubicic . ivo karlovic broke roger federer 's serve for the first time in his life , but the top seed and world number one progressed in a late match on wednesday . croatian karlovic , the tallest man in tennis at 2.08 metres , went down 6-4 4-6 6-3 as federer played for the first time at the bercy event since 2003 . federer had gone 67 service games over four previous matches without a loss before karlovic ended his duck to claim their second set . but the swiss top seed got straight back in harness , breaking to start the final set and rolling ahead against a man he had just beaten days earlier in the basel semifinals . world numbet two rafael nadal also reached the third round after thrashing italy 's filippo volandri 6-3 6-1 . the spaniard will next play stanislas wawrinka of switzerland , who won by the same scoreline against 16th seed juan ignacio chela of argentina . e-mail to a friend .

75	san diego , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- you must know what 's really driving the immigration debate . it 's the culture , stupid . ruben navarrette jr. : some opponents of immigration , even the legal kind , fear changes in local culture . immigration restrictionists -- and by that , i mean those who want to limit all immigration , even the legal kind -- like to pretend they 're so high-minded . yet they ca n't help themselves . they always take the low road and harken back to the nativism that greeted earlier waves of immigrants . the restrictionists insist that what bothers them are merely practical concerns : that our borders are n't secure , that so many immigrants are coming into the country illegally , and that the new arrivals are burdening schools and draining social services once they get here . really ? if that 's the extent of it , then why does the conversation quickly turn to the impact -- both real and perceived -- that immigrants have on american culture through everything from taco trucks to spanish-language billboards . that seems to be the issue in north dakota , where , according to a recent article in usa today , towns facing tough economic times are nonetheless resisting a cultural transfusion that could save them . in cooperstown , the locals opposed efforts to bring in a hog plant and a dairy , because those kind of dirty and hard jobs are likely to attract ... guess who ? american kids who work at starbucks ? nope . the article quotes orville tranby , a local community leader in cooperstown , who says that some residents have told him `` face to face '' that such facilities might attract hispanic immigrants who could change the local culture . you 'll find the same fear in lewisburg , tennessee . not long ago , an employee at a local library came up with the radical idea of a bilingual story time where children could hear tales read to them in spanish . townspeople wanted no part of that . they demanded that all books purchased by the library , or even donated , be in english-only . these stories are ridiculous , but they 're also helpful . they illustrate what some people are really concerned about with immigration , and it goes well beyond words like `` legal '' or `` illegal . '' it 's the perception that the country is becoming more hispanic , that spanish is replacing english , that hispanic immigrants are weakening american identity , and that main street is turning into little mexico . a leader of the vigilante minuteman movement moronically called it the `` colonization '' of the united states . this sort of rhetoric is all about fear -- that those who thrive in the dominant culture are losing their primacy , that the mainstream is being polluted by foreigners , and that our children are going to live in a world where they 're going to have to work a lot harder to keep up . it conjures up the alarm bells that benjamin franklin set off about german immigrants in the late 18th century , who he insisted could never adopt the culture of the english , but would `` swarm into our settlements , and by herding together establish their language and manners to the exclusion of ours . '' it popped up in the mid-19th century amid worries that chinese immigrants were `` unassimilable , '' which led to congress approving the explicitly-named chinese exclusion act of 1882 . and it helped welcome the 20th century when massachusetts sen. henry cabot lodge warned that immigrants -lrb- read : the irish -rrb- were diluting `` the quality of -lrb- u.s. -rrb- citizenship '' and others complained that italian immigrants were uneducated , low skilled , apt to send all their money to their home country and prone to criminal activity . where have we heard that before ? and when will we hear it again ? after all , hispanics may be the latest group to find themselves in a culture war with nativists . but they wo n't be the last . ruben navarrette jr. is a member of the editorial board of the san diego union-tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . you can read his column here . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer . e-mail to a friend .

81	shanghai , china -- championship leader lewis hamilton spun out of the chinese grand prix to send the world title race to a cliffhanger finale in brazil on october 21 . a disconsolate lewis hamilton leaves his car after spinning into the gravel trap in shanghai . rookie hamilton can still clinch the crown with third place in the closing race , but saw his 12-point lead cut to four by mclaren team-mate fernando alonso in shanghai . the spaniard finished second behind ferrari 's kimi raikkonen , who also kept his title hopes alive by moving within seven points of hamilton . the young briton started the race in pole position and at one stage led raikkonen by more than eight seconds as he again showed superb skills in the wet conditions . however , the 22-year-old stayed out on the drying track too long in his wet tires , which deteriorated at an alarming rate to let finland 's raikkonen take the lead . and when hamilton -- who won in japan last week to give himself the chance of clinching the title this weekend -- finally headed toward the pit lane , he spun out onto the gravel to end his chances with 25 laps to go . raikkonen and alonso both switched to dry tires on the 32nd of the 56 laps , with the finn going on to win by by 9.8 seconds for his fifth victory this season -- one more than both hamilton and alonso . raikkone 's team-mate felipe massa was third , while fourth place was claimed by toro rosso 's sebastien vettel , who was last week reprimanded for causing an accident in japan behind the safety car while hamilton was cleared of any wrongdoing . britain 's jenson button was fifth in a honda ahead of vettel 's team-mate vitantonio liuzzi , while germany 's nick heidfeld was seventh for bmw sauber and david coulthard of scotland took the final point for red bull . hamilton was still confident he could bounce back after suffering his first retirement of the season . `` i 'm sorry for the team but i can still do it , do n't worry , '' he said . `` when i got out of the car i was just gutted because it was my first mistake all year , and to do it on the way into the pits was not something i usually do . `` you can not go through life without making mistakes . but i am over it and we look forward to brazil . the team will be working hard to make sure the car is quick enough there , and we still have points in the bag . `` we were having a great race and we did n't know if it was going to rain or not . the tyres were getting worse and worse and you could almost see the canvas underneath . when i came into the pits it was like ice , i could n't do anything about it . '' mclaren boss ron dennis refused to blame his driver or his team for the spin-off . `` it 's too extreme to say anyone made a mistake in this . it has been a very competitive season between our drivers and it will go on for another grand prix , '' dennis said . `` i do n't think we did anything dramatically wrong and neither did lewis . but the circuit was considerably drier than the pit lane entrance . that 's what made the difference . `` it was easy to say that we could have stopped earlier , but would it have made a difference ? all the top teams -- ferrari and ourselves -- were trying to get through the rain and straight onto a dry tire . '' alonso , who qualified for the race in fourth , is seeking to become the third driver to win three world titles . `` the result was good today and the eight points are a help for sure , '' he said . `` i think the championship will still be very difficult because i know it will not be easy to take four points from lewis . `` i need something dramatic if i want to win . with a normal race it will be impossible . '' raikkonen added : `` we are back in the championship and it will be interesting in the final race . `` hopefully the car is good and it will be a battle all weekend . it is not just up to us though , we saw today that anything can happen , but we are back in the championship .

84	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- polygamist sect leader warren jeffs tried to hang himself earlier this year while he was in jail awaiting trial , according to court documents unsealed by a utah judge on tuesday . sect leader warren jeffs arrives in court to hear the verdict against him september 25 in st. george , utah . jeffs , the leader and so-called prophet of the 10,000-member fundamentalist church of jesus christ of latter day saints , is now awaiting sentencing after being convicted on two counts of being an accomplice to rape . the documents , released by fifth district judge james shumate at the request of the media , also indicate that jeffs confessed to `` immorality '' with a `` sister '' and a daughter more than 30 years ago . among the documents is a competency report on jeffs completed in april , in which social worker eric nielsen wrote that throughout the month of january , jeffs refused food and drink and developed ulcers on his knees from kneeling in prayer for hours . on january 28 , the report said , he attempted to hang himself in his cell . in the days following the suicide attempt , while he was on suicide watch , jeffs on separate occasions threw himself against the wall and banged his head on the wall . jail transcripts show that jeffs ' suicide attempt came three days after a visit with his brother , nephi , in which he said , `` i am not the prophet . i never was the prophet , and i have been deceived by the powers of evil ... i ask for everyone 's forgiveness . '' jeffs also told his brother : `` farewell forever . '' the day before that , jeffs told a follower in a phone conversation that he was `` covered with immorality with a sister and a daughter when i was younger . '' in the flds , members call adult women `` sister , '' and jeffs ' meaning was unclear . jeffs ' defense attorneys , who argued against the release of the documents , said in a motion opposing the unsealing of the statements that jeffs recanted them the following month . defense attorneys claim jeffs ' medical condition influenced his state of mind when the statements were made . they presented shumate with a letter from another jeffs attorney , arguing that the statements ' release could influence an arizona jury when jeffs stands trial in that state . jeffs , 51 , was convicted in september of being an accomplice to rape . he was accused of using his religious influence over his followers to coerce a 14-year-old girl into marriage to her 19-year-old cousin . he faces a sentence of up to life in prison when he is sentenced november 20 . the flds -- which is not affiliated with the mainstream mormon church -- is based in the side-by-side border towns of hildale , utah , and colorado city , arizona . jeffs , a former school headmaster , is the son of the sect 's previous president and `` prophet , '' rulon jeffs , who died in 2002 . jeffs was on the fbi 's 10 most wanted fugitives list when he was arrested in august 2006 outside las vegas , nevada . critics say that inside the flds , marriages are arranged for girls as young as 13 , and competition for brides may be reduced by exiling male teens and young men . if male followers are excommunicated , critics claim , wives and children can be reassigned . during jeffs ' trial , defense attorneys claimed authorities were persecuting jeffs because of his religious beliefs , including practicing polygamy as the way to heaven . if jeffs disavowed being the prophet of the flds , it could cause upheaval within the secretive sect . however , two of his followers who spoke to cnn -- although flds members usually do not talk to reporters -- said they do not believe he made the statements . `` he is a perfectly priestly man , '' said a woman who identified herself as cathy . `` he is a man of god , and we will always love him . once a prophet , always a prophet . '' her husband , patrick , told cnn , `` it 's hogwash . i do n't believe it ... i will always consider him my prophet . '' e-mail to a friend . cnn 's gary tuchman contributed to this report .

86	algiers , algeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- rescuers are sifting through the rubble of the united nations headquarters in algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building 's facade and leveled nearby u.n. offices . rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building . it was one of two suspected car bombs that struck algiers within 10 minutes of each other . the death toll is unclear : the official government count is at least 26 , but hospital sources in algiers told cnn affiliate bfm-tv that 76 people were killed in the two blasts . a statement from the united nations said 45 people were reported killed . algerian interior minister noureddine yazid zerhouni blamed a militant islamic group with ties to al qaeda for the attacks , which also targeted a building housing algeria 's constitutional council and supreme court . in a posting on an islamist web site , the group al qaeda islamic maghreb claimed responsibility . cnn could not immediately corroborate that claim , but the web site is known to carry messages , claims and videos from al qaeda and other militant groups . in the posting , the bombers were identified as sheikh ibrahim abu othman and abdel rahman abu abdel nasser al-asimi . it said two trucks were filled with `` no less than 800 kg -lrb- 1,763 pounds -rrb- of explosives . '' the group called the operation `` another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood , defending the wounded islamic nation and in defiance to the crusaders and their agents , the slaves of america and the sons of france . '' at least 10 u.n. staffers were among those killed , according to u.n. spokeswoman marie okabe . the offices of the un high commissioner for refugees -- located across the street from the u.n. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. -lrb- 3:30 a.m. et -rrb- tuesday . `` our offices are basically destroyed now , nothing works , '' unhcr spokesman ron redmond said from its geneva headquarters . watch his full interview . he said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped u.n. workers . `` it 's a very serious situation still with the u.n. in algiers , '' he said . in a strongly worded statement , u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon condemned what he called `` an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity 's highest ideals under the u.n. banner . '' `` the perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by algerian authorities and the international community , '' ban said in the written statement . he said he has sent senior advisers and other top u.n. officials to head to algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort . most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the constitutional council -- which oversees elections -- and supreme court in the algiers neighborhood of ben aknoun , according to the state-run algeria press agency . that blast struck a bus outside the targeted building , killing many of those on board , the news agency reported . one man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him . `` i saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me . i had to run away from the car , '' he said . zerhouni said the attack was the work of the salafist group for preaching and combat -lrb- gspc -rrb- , the same group that took responsibility for an attack in april in downtown algiers that killed 33 people . that group also uses the name al qaeda islamic maghreb after merging with al qaeda earlier this year . it abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al qaeda . cnn international security correspondent paula newton said the merger combined the expertise of algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al qaeda in north africa , enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of algiers . she said the group 's goal is to destabilize countries like algeria , morocco and tunisia , which it sees as enemies of the islamic state . zerhouni said police interrogations of gspc members arrested in the wake of the april attack revealed that algeria 's constitutional council and supreme court were on a list of gspc targets . algeria , which has a population of 33 million , is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an islamist party was poised to win . tens of thousands of people died in the unrest . although the country has remained relatively peaceful , recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence . e-mail to a friend .

88	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- there are some circuits that are cornerstones of the formula 1 calendar : the monacos and silverstones whose every twist and turn are known intimately by the drivers and engineers . then there are the newer circuits -- malaysia and bahrain , for instance -- but even these have become familiar to the drivers and their backroom boffins . fuji speedway employees pose behind a scale model of the new circuit and in front of an overhead view . next week they have something completely new to contend with : a track that has yet to see a single f1 team put in a single lap . the japan grand prix is to return to the fuji speedway , a circuit that has n't seen an f1 race since 1977 -lrb- though now with a substantially different track layout -rrb- . the fuji circuit will be familiar to fans of classic arcade games . the old fuji speedway was the setting for the 1982 arcade game pole position -lrb- released by namco in japan and atari in the rest of the world -rrb- . the most notable aspect of the circuit is the vision of mount fuji , japan 's tallest mountain , looming in the distance . though the move to this picturesque location is not without its controversies . the suzuka track -- which had held japanese grands prix between 1987 and 2006 -- had been popular with drivers and fans alike , but for this year and the next the japanese grand prix will be held at fuji . however an announcement by formula one management -lrb- fom -rrb- this month revealed that suzuka will return to the calendar for 2009 -- on the condition that the circuit makes some approved modifications -- with the location of the japanese grand prix alternating yearly between fuji and suzuka after that . behind the scenes is a political battleground -- both circuits are owned by car manufacturers with f1 connections -- honda owns suzuka , toyota owns fuji . toyota is a relative newcomer to f1 but , having this year surpassed general motors as the world 's number one automobile manufacturer , and reputedly having the best funded team in the paddock -lrb- a position that has n't been reflected in sporting success -rrb- , it is not without clout . the redesign of the fuji track was carried out by hermann tilke in 2003 . tilke , a german architect redesigned a number of f1 circuits in the 1990s and has since designed many new grand prix tracks including malaysia , istanbul , bahrain and shanghai , and the tracks for 2008 's debut grands prix in singapore and valencia . so how do f1 teams prepare for a new circuit such as fuji without data from previous races to fall back on ? the answer lies with computer simulation . computer-aided design -lrb- cad -rrb- is as much a part of the design of a circuit these days as it is a part of the design of the high-tech cars . every bend , every straight and every camber is fastidiously analyzed on screen before an ounce of dirt is shifted on the ground itself . despite never having raced on the circuit , the teams have been testing their cars on a virtual fuji speedway for some time . bmw sauber 's simulation experts received cad data from the japanese race organizers late last year . and when their cars arrive at fuji for testing next week , their race set-up should be close to optimum . the circuit was analyzed and broken up into between 500 and 800 segments . the radius of each individual segment was measured , allowing the engineers to exactly calculate the optimum racing line -lrb- the route around the circuit that covers the shortest possible distance -rrb- . then the effects of factors such as gradients and inclines were calculated . the slightest change in angle of a gradient can have significant effects on the downforce and aerodynamic profile of a car . `` in order to avoid losing precious time during the race weekend , we need to have as accurate as possible a picture of downforce levels , gearbox ratios and brake specification in advance , '' says willy rampf , technical director of the bmw sauber f1 team . dieter glass , chief race and test engineer with toyota f1 explains : . `` you start to determine what downforce level gives the best lap time on the new circuit . once you know that , you look into which gear ratios suit the track with the given level of downforce , before you get into more detailed simulations of different set-up solutions . `` getting a bit closer to the weekend , you start running race simulations in order to predict the optimum race strategy . this prediction takes into account estimates of relevant characteristics of the new track , like the degradation of the two bridgestone tire compounds and the effect the fuel has on lap time . if you have more fuel in the car , this affects your lap time , but we can accurately predict how much time is lost with every extra kilogram of fuel carried . '' one peculiarity of the fuji circuit is the exceptionally long main straight , which at 1.475 km -lrb- 0.916 miles -rrb- will allow for higher-than average-straight line speeds but , after the straight the track is relatively twisty . the teams have to find a balance between getting the most speed into the straight , and the best grip decelerating into the bends . `` you have some very slow corners which require good mechanical grip , '' says glass , `` and as always you want good grip in general , but you have to balance that with the long straight , where you need low enough downforce to get a level of drag which allows you to have a good top speed . '' the testing may be virtual , but the teams hope that these virtual figures are a hair 's breadth away from real world eventualities : . `` our aim is to ensure that the lap times and top speed calculated using the simulation software do not vary by more than one percent from the actual values , '' says rampf . not that everything can be predicted : `` i think we are quite accurate but the ultimate response to that is very difficult to say for sure because it very much depends on what happens in the race , '' continues glass . `` many incidents can happen , which then have a positive or an adverse affect on strategy .

89	new albany , indiana -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush vetoed a $ 600 billion spending bill tuesday , accusing democratic leaders of wasting money and plotting tax increases , then took his budget fight with congress on the road . congress should cut spending `` and send me a responsible measure that i can sign into law , '' president bush said . `` the majority was elected on a pledge of fiscal responsibility , but so far , it 's acting like a teenager with a new credit card , '' he said in a speech in new albany , indiana . the bill -- which bush said was laden with $ 10 billion in `` pork '' -- would have funded the departments of labor , education , and health and human services . it also would have funded projects such as a prison museum , a sailing school and a program to teach portuguese . `` congress needs to cut out that pork , reduce the spending and send me a responsible measure that i can sign into law , '' the president said . watch a report on the veto '' while polls show bush 's popularity remains at near-record lows , congress ranks even lower as a whole . the president has taken numerous opportunities to mock the spending habits of the democratic leadership and force confrontations over the appropriations bills needed to fund the government for the 2008 budget year , which began october 1 . the bill bush vetoed tuesday includes about $ 150 billion to run those departments and more than $ 450 billion in mandatory spending on medicare and medicaid , the federal health care programs for the elderly and poor , according to the house appropriations committee . the committee 's chairman , rep. david obey , called bush 's veto `` not responsible and not credible . '' `` this is a bipartisan bill supported by over 50 republicans , '' obey , d-wisconsin , said in a statement issued after the veto . `` there has been virtually no criticism of its contents . it is clear the only reason the president vetoed this bill is pure politics . '' bush said democrats are supporting $ 22 billion in additional spending beyond his budget proposals this year and $ 205 billion over five years -- money he said would ultimately be raised by tax increases . `` when the bill for all that spending comes due , congress is going to turn to the working people , to the small-business owners and the entrepreneurs , '' he said . tuesday 's veto is the fifth cast since democrats took control of congress in 2006 . congress has overridden one of those , voting last week to authorize $ 23 billion in water projects nationwide over the president 's objections . democrats will schedule another override vote this week , an aide to house majority leader steny hoyer said . but antonia ferrier , spokeswoman for house republican whip roy blunt , said bush 's gop allies are confident they will be able to sustain the veto . bush signed a $ 470 billion pentagon spending bill that covers the defense department 's normal operations , but democrats split $ 50 billion in spending for the wars in iraq and afghanistan off into a `` bridge fund '' to which they plan to attach demands for bush to withdraw u.s. combat troops . the measure sets up another confrontation with the white house . bush also demanded congress reform the alternative minimum tax -- a measure originally aimed at preventing the wealthy from evading taxes , but one that increasingly affects middle-class earners -- without raising additional revenue . he said a plan proposed by rep. charles rangel , the democratic chairman of the house ways and means committee , to eliminate the tax was unacceptable . `` preventing a tax increase in one area should not be an excuse for raising taxes in other areas , '' he said . `` congress should eliminate the tax increases in the bill and send the amt relief to my desk as soon as possible . '' the elimination of the tax would cause an estimated $ 800 billion to be lost over 10 years . to replace that , rangel 's bill would add a 4 percent surtax on individual incomes over $ 100,000 , after deductions , and close corporate tax loopholes . the bill also would cut rates for many individual and corporate taxpayers . republicans have already started calling it `` the mother of all tax increases . '' `` with all the other pressures on our economy , raising taxes is one of the most unwise things congress could possibly do , '' bush said . bush acknowledged the difficulties americans face from high fuel prices , a `` challenged '' housing market and `` uncertainty '' in financial markets stemming from the collapse of the subprime mortgage market -- `` but as we have seen in recent years , this economy is resilient , and that 's important for the american people to understand .

90	nyon , switzerland -- celtic have been fined $ 50,800 by uefa and ac milan 's dida has been banned for two matches after the incident which saw a pitch-invading supporter approach the brazilian goalkeeper in last week 's champions league match at celtic park . dida 's theatrical over-reaction has resulted in uefa suspending him for two matches . the incident occurred when the scottish side beat milan 2-1 in glasgow . a fan ran onto the field in the 90th minute , soon after the home side scored their winning goal , and made what appeared to be minimal contact with dida . the milan goalkeeper turned to chase the supporter before dropping to the ground . he was carried off the field on a stretcher and replaced . dida 's theatrical over-reaction has cost him severely -- but celtic may choose not to complain about their own punishment , with half of their fine suspended for two years . uefa did have the power to change the result of the match , although that was always unlikely . uefa 's control and disciplinary body found celtic guilty of charges of `` lack of organisation and improper conduct of supporters '' , while dida was found to have breached uefa 's `` principles of loyalty , integrity and sportsmanship '' . milan have pledged to appeal against the punishment , which as it stands means he will miss the club 's champions league games against shakhtar donetsk . `` it 's a suspension that is absolutely excessive , '' said milan lawyer leandro cantamessa . `` it seems to us a very , very unbalanced sentence . it turns dida into the protagonist of the incident , whereas the protagonist was someone else , and that 's not right from a logical point of view . '' celtic acted swiftly to punish the 27-year-old supporter , who turned himself in and has since admitted a breach of the peace in court and will be sentenced next month . the club banned the fan for life from all their matches , home and away . celtic chief executive peter lawwell said : `` as a club we feel this penalty is proportionate to the incident in question and a fair outcome .

92	st. petersburg , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the acrimony from the republican campaign trail carried over quickly into the cnn/youtube gop presidential debate wednesday . the debate marked the first time the candidates had faced off on the same stage in over a month . with five weeks to go until the first contest of the 2008 nominating season , the republican candidates engaged in a free-for-all , trying to differentiate their views on immigration , the iraq war , abortion , gun control and even whether they believed every word in the bible was true . unlike previous debates in which the candidates focused most of their attacks on democratic front-runner hillary clinton , wednesday night 's attacks were launched at each other . former new york mayor rudy giuliani and former massachusetts gov. mitt romney traded jabs over illegal immigration , something they have been arguing about on the trail for the past month . romney attacked giuliani 's record , saying that as mayor , he promoted illegal immigration . and giuliani shot back , accusing romney of having a `` sanctuary mansion '' at his own home . watch the debate format produce raw moments '' `` in his case , there were six sanctuary cities . he did nothing about them . there was a sanctuary mansion -- at his own home , illegal immigrants were being employed , '' giuliani said . romney denied giuliani 's allegation , and the two raised their voices as they tried to talk over each other . in his quest to appeal to the hard-line immigration wing of the party , romney also turned some of his fire on the same topic toward former arkansas gov. mike huckabee , who has been rising in the polls . rep. tom tancredo , who has anchored his candidacy on securing the borders and cracking down on illegal immigration , seemed delighted with the give and take , saying the other candidates were trying to `` out-tancredo '' him . huckabee drew one of the night 's largest cheers when he said that one of the agencies he would abolish to control federal spending was the internal revenue service . `` most people in this country are more afraid of an audit than they are of a mugging , and there 's a reason why , '' he said . sen. john mccain , freshly back from a visit to iraq over thanksgiving and the most hawkish of the candidates , and rep. ron paul , the most anti-war of the candidates , tangled on two occasions over the iraq war . did youtubers get their questions answered ?

93	denver , colorado -- a colorado man terrorized by threats after testifying against his daughter 's abusive boyfriend says he has spent $ 10,000 on a security system , hired a bodyguard for his son 's wedding and never leaves home without a .45 - caliber handgun strapped to his chest . keith reynolds was convicted for witness intimidation after threatening witnesses in his domestic assault case . the man , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the case , says the state did nothing to protect him after the 1999 conviction of keith reynolds for domestic abuse -- even after prosecutors told him a hit had been put on his family . a report in the denver post pointed out major problems protecting witnesses in the state of colorado . paul logli , chairman of national district attorneys association , told congress this year that witness intimidation has become `` almost epidemic , '' according to the denver post . when asked if prosecutors had made the family aware of colorado 's witness protection program , the witness in the reynolds case said , `` all they told us was maybe we should move . '' `` i 'm pretty sure i told one of them -- either him or his wife -- about the program . i ca n't remember if i gave them all the details . '' the prosecutor assigned to the case , who did n't want to be named , told cnn . after reynolds ' conviction , the witness and his wife saw strange cars parked outside their home . they received phone calls during which the only sound on the other end of the line was a gun being cocked . the couple received a death threat from reynolds himself through the mail . watch witness describe fear of being targeted '' reynolds was then sentenced to ten years in a maximum security prison for witness intimidation . however , it is likely he 'll be released within five years . no national statistics on crimes against witnesses exist , and minimal research has been conducted on the subject . the latest national institute of justice survey on record -- conducted more than a decade ago -- shows that more than half of big city prosecutors consider witness intimidation a major problem . colorado has $ 50,000 allocated to its witness protection budget . in contrast , the city of denver spent almost $ 100,000 on landscaping last year . the state , on average , spends about $ 1,000 per witness . that figure supposedly includes moving expenses , rent , and furniture . the federal program spends in excess of $ 40 million per year on witness protection . one possible reason for the disparity is that witnesses in state cases do not get new identities , as do federal witnesses . `` it 's not designed to be a long-term relocation at the public 's expense ; it 's a way to ensure the immediate safety of the witnesses , '' according to peter weir , executive director of the colorado department of public safety . colorado 's witness protection program is a `` joke , '' according to the rev. leon kelly , founder and executive director of the open door youth gang alternatives . kelly says the state does n't provide enough incentive for witnesses to come forward . more than a decade ago , a young man named darryl givens asked kelly for advice while deciding whether to testify in a murder case or face prison . givens chose to testify . a few months later , he was shot twice in the head by men he considered friends . that day continues to haunt kelly . rhonda fields says failures in the witness protection program may have contributed to her son 's murder . javad fields was a college graduate who was engaged to be married . he had plans to move east when a fourth of july barbecue in 2004 in changed all that . he witnessed the murder of his best friend and subsequently testified against three men suspected in the killing . javad fields and his fiancee were gunned down while driving along a suburban street in aurora , colorado . the couple , both 22 , died instantly . rhonda fields says her son was never told about a witness protection program . she confronted prosecutors after his murder . fields told cnn , `` i asked them what happened . why were n't any measures taken to safeguard his life ? and i was told he never asked for any protection . '' javad 's mother does not think it was her son 's responsibility to ask for protection . `` i think it 's the authorities ' responsibility to notify witnesses of the dangers that are involved with being a witness , '' she said . field 's case illustrates glaring weaknesses in the witness protection program . prosecutors filed an order for protection requesting javad fields ' personal information be kept secret , but it was n't signed by a judge until one year later , after defense lawyers had already given the suspects fields ' personal information , along with crucial trial documents . `` i felt like the da 's office used my son to win their case but did not take the proper measures to safeguard his life , '' rhonda fields told cnn . district attorney carol chambers maintains the program has improved . she says a notice about witness protection is now attached to every subpoena , ensuring witnesses are aware of their options . that did n't start , however , until two years after javad fields was killed . e-mail to a friend .

95	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the white house is blasting congressional democrats for not sending a bill that would fund veterans ' care programs to the president 's desk by veterans day . the white house 's dana perino accused democrats of holding veterans care funding hostage . `` there 's absolutely no reason that the veterans ' bill could not have been signed by the president today , except for the political games that the democrats decided to play with it , '' white house press secretary dana perino said sunday in crawford , texas . congressional democrats had attached legislation funding veterans programs to a $ 150.7 billion bill that also funded a number of domestic priorities , including health , labor and education . democrats also added $ 3.7 billion to what the president budgeted for veterans programs . the labor-health-education bill would increase funding by more than $ 10 billion over last year 's funding for those programs . the president has threatened to veto the bill because of the added spending . the house passed a health-labor-education bill 269-142 last week with the veterans funding attached , but the senate later voted to strip out the veterans funding and send the health-labor-education bill to the president . perino accused the democrats of `` trying to hold hostage our veterans to extra domestic spending or increases in taxes . '' `` the president wants clean legislation , a clean bill to fund the veterans , '' perino said . on saturday , the democratic congressional leadership sent a letter to president bush saying they welcomed a dialogue on spending , sayings disagreements over funding levels `` have never been so great that we can not reach agreement on a spending plan that meets the needs of the american people . '' `` key to this dialogue , however , is some willingness on your part to actually find common ground , '' house speaker nancy pelosi , d-california , and senate majority leader harry reid , d-nevada , said in the letter . the leadership said last year 's congress , which was still under republican control , had never passed a separate bill funding veterans programs . congress also sent to the president legislation that would fund veterans care at the levels requested by the president through december 14 , the leadership said . the current funding level `` is still below the $ 3.9 billion extra that we passed , '' said nadeam elshami , spokesman pelosi . `` we are committed to getting the extra funding that the congress already voted on the president 's desk for his signature . '' the leadership blamed republican members of congress for stalling the funding for the veterans programs by blocking its inclusion in the larger spending bill . perino , though , said the democrats could still send a separate bill to the president funding the veterans program that passed both chambers of congress . `` the democrats decided not to send the president this bill , '' perino said . `` that has to be laid at their feet .

96	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- republicans reacted with surprise and recrimination sunday to blistering criticism of the iraq war from former coalition commander retired lt. gen. ricardo sanchez . lawmakers lashed back at retired gen. ricardo sanchez on sunday after he criticized the war effort . on friday , sanchez , who was coalition commander in 2003 and 2004 , called the iraq war `` a nightmare with no end in sight . '' he said the bush administration , the state department and congress all share blame . speaking with military reporters in virginia , sanchez also said such dereliction of duty by a military officer would mean immediate dismissal or court martial , but the politicians have not been held accountable . `` i 'm astounded , really , '' south carolina republican sen. lindsey graham on cnn 's `` late edition '' with wolf blitzer on sunday . graham , who recently returned from baghdad , said he and gop presidential candidate sen. john mccain had visited sanchez several times in 2003 and 2004 . `` every time we talked to gen. sanchez , we got pushback -- we have enough troops ; guard and reserves are n't being strained , '' graham said . he added that sanchez 's own record in iraq is blemished : abu ghraib `` got out of control under his watch . the war in general got out of control under his watch . '' but graham said that `` finally , '' with the commitment of nearly 30,000 additional u.s. troops since january , `` we are getting it right . '' sanchez told reporters that american political leaders have cost american lives on the battlefield with their `` lust for power . '' sanchez said it had been his duty to obey orders and not object publicly while on active duty , but that he has an obligation to speak out now that he has retired . `` while the politicians espouse a rhetoric designed to preserve their reputations and their political power , our soldiers die , '' he said . that brought a tart response from mccain , the ranking republican on the senate armed services committee . `` i wish that he had given us the benefit of that knowledge at the time , '' mccain told cbs 's `` face the nation . '' he said sanchez should have spoken out at the time -- or resigned -- but `` unfortunately , that does n't happen very often . '' one of the reasons few speak out , he said , is evidenced by what happened to former army chief of staff gen. eric shinseki , mccain said . shinseki was sidelined after telling congress that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to occupy iraq . sen. mitch mcconnell , a republican from kentucky , told abc 's `` this week '' that sanchez is simply wrong . `` my definition of winning is a stable country and an ally in the war on terror , '' he said . `` i think we 're making significant progress toward that end . '' but , he added , `` i think the central government in iraq has been an embarrassment . they 've not been able to produce any of the kind of political compromises that we had hoped for . '' graham said he hopes the government of prime minister nuri al-maliki will `` step up to the plate and do something meaningful by the end of the year . '' if that does not happen , he said , `` it will be incumbent upon us , as a nation , to devise a new political strategy to find a way forward or create a stable iraq . '' that brought a blistering response from zbigniew brzezinski , national security adviser under president carter . `` what is this ? this is a colony , '' he said . `` that 's the heart and essence of the difficulties we encounter . '' even those iraqis who were happy to see saddam hussein toppled from power more than four years ago are not happy with the continuing u.s. presence , brzezinski said . though some countries are willing to go along with the united states , `` no one in the world really supports our policy in iraq , '' he said . in his friday speech , sanchez added that the `` surge '' of u.s. troops into iraq represents `` a desperate attempt by the administration that has not accepted the political and economic realities of this war . '' national security council spokeswoman kate starr did not address the comment . instead , she said , `` we appreciate his service to the country . as gen. petraeus and ambassador crocker said , there 's more work to be done but progress is being made in iraq . and that 's what we 're focused on now .

'' stone said the releases would continue at the same pace beyond ramadan . stone 's description seems a far cry from the abu ghraib prison operated by the u.s. military in the first years after the invasion . that prison was closed down and razed in the wake of an international scandal over prisoner abuse . `` there are no secrets that go on in detention , '' stone said . `` our facilities are open to inspection by any agency that we in the federal government believe is credible . these agencies are welcomed because they are windows for the world . '' see what life 's like inside camp cropper 's walls '' by the time of their release , `` detainees grow in terms of working in an inter-sectarian environment , '' he said . each detainee has a chance to take classes up to a sixth-grade level , and high school classes are being planned , stone said . about one-third -- or 8,000 -- are in school , with 7,000 having passed the fifth-grade level , he said . the 860 detainees who are 17 or younger are all in school , stone said . the average stay for a detainee is 300 days , but some have been detained for two years or longer , he said . a review board interviews detainees to decide if they are a threat to security , he said . if they are deemed not to be , they are offered freedom in exchange for taking the pledge . only 280 detainees are foreigners , mostly from syria , egypt , iran , sudan and saudi arabia , he said . other developments .

'' turner said she believes the visit may come before christmas . a jury convicted winkler earlier this year of voluntary manslaughter in the shotgun death of matthew winkler -- not the first-degree murder conviction prosecutors had wanted . she said the slaying came after years of abuse , including physical violence and being forced to dress `` slutty '' for undesirable sex acts . winkler received a three-year sentence , but a judge required her to serve only 210 days , gave her credit for the five months she had already served and allowed her to serve the remaining 60 days in a mental health facility . she was released in august . at the time of their father 's death in march 2006 , patricia was 8 , mary alice was 6 and brianna was 1 . charles and diane winkler have moved to terminate mary winkler 's rights and have filed a $ 2 million wrongful death suit against her for their son 's slaying . the termination issue has not been decided in court . turner said the court may want to determine what , if any , bond winkler has with her children before making a decision . attempts by cnn to contact attorneys for the winklers were not immediately successful wednesday . in september , a lower court granted winkler visitation with her daughters pending the outcome of the custody battle . the court specified the visits be supervised by a guardian ad litem appointed to represent the children 's interests and supervised by members of the couple winkler is living with or by her sister . a subsequent appeal by the grandparents was denied , leading to their supreme court appeal . the winklers said if their former daughter-in-law got visitation with the children at all , it should be under the supervision of a professional counselor . at a september hearing , according to court documents , they said the children `` exhibit fear and confusion '' toward their mother `` and her role in their father 's death . '' one expert , in testimony , quoted patricia as saying her mother had killed her father and , `` i do n't know if she will kill me . i want to ask her if she would do that to me . it scares me , kind of ; if she did , well , i guess i would see my father . '' the winklers also said that after telephone calls with their mother , the children experienced `` urination accidents , sleeping problems , graphic nightmares and sleepwalking . '' they said the lower court erred by failing to appoint the guardian ad litem until after the september hearing . turner , however , said she believes terminating winkler 's parental rights would not be in the children 's best interest . `` she has a faith rarely seen , and she loves those children , '' turner said . after matthew winkler 's death , winkler fled with the girls to the alabama coast , where she was arrested . she said during a september appearance on the `` oprah winfrey show '' that she never expected to get away with killing her husband , but that she fled to be with her daughters and `` have some good times .

'' churchgoers in all six states recently finished 35 days of praying alongside interstate 35 , but the prayers are still continuing . some of the faithful believe that in order to fulfill the prophecy of i-35 being the `` holy '' highway , it needs some intensive prayer first . so we watched as about 25 fervent and enthusiastic christians prayed on the the interstate 's shoulder in dallas . they chanted loudly and vibrantly , making many people in the neighborhood wonder what was going on . they prayed that adult businesses along the corridor would `` see the light '' and perhaps close down . they prayed for safety and freedom from crime for people who lived along the interstate . they prayed that all americans would accept jesus into their lives . watch believers offer prayers '' the woman who came up with the concept of `` light the highway '' is a texas minister named cindy jacobs . she says she ca n't be sure interstate 35 really is what is mentioned in the bible but says she received a revelation to start this campaign after `` once again reading isaiah , chapter 35 . '' jacobs also points out that perhaps there is a link between the area near this highway and tragedies that have happened in history , such as the bridge collapse on i-35 in minneapolis last august and the assassination of jfk 44 years ago near i-35 in dallas . that 's why prayer certainly ca n't hurt , she adds . now , it 's only fair to say most people , the religious and the non-religious alike , do n't buy any of this , but none more than the owners of some of the adult businesses along i-35 . at an adult go-go club , the owner tells us he resents people trying to impose their will on others . and he says his club holds fundraisers , food drives and toy drives to help the community . but on the side of the road , the prayerful are n't going to change their minds . holy highways and nude clubs , they believe , are not a combination god has in mind . e-mail to a friend .
104	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a day after new jersey banned executions , newly released figures show that capital punishment dropped this year to a 13-year low . the supreme court will hold oral arguments january 7 about the constitutionality of lethal injection protocols . forty-two people have been put to death this year , according to the death penalty information center -lrb- dpic -rrb- , a washington-based group that opposes the practice . that figure is down 57 percent from what it was in 1999 , when 98 inmates were executed . next year 's figures are expected to drop further . the supreme court is to hold oral arguments january 7 about whether lethal injection protocols in 36 of the 37 states with the death penalty are constitutional . see how the rates have dropped '' the justices placed a moratorium on executions in late september , when they decided to review a kentucky case about whether the three-drug lethal `` cocktail '' of chemicals represents `` cruel and unusual punishment , '' since it may cause excruciating pain to inmates unable to express discomfort . stays of executions have been issued in several states until the larger constitutional issues are addressed . if the high court finds the procedures unconstitutional , it could take years before death-penalty states would meet legal standards necessary to resume lethal injection . and even if the method is declared acceptable , it would be months before new execution dates could be set . ten states carried out executions this year . outside the south , arizona , south dakota , indiana , and ohio together subjected six men to lethal injection . learn about states ' death penalty policies and statistics '' texas continues to lead the nation , with 62 percent of executions nationwide this year . overall , 86 percent this year were in the south . no more executions are scheduled this year . `` the death penalty has been in a period of decline for many years , '' said richard dieter , executive director of dpic . `` two thousand seven will be known as the year executions came to a temporary halt and as the year of concrete legislation reconsidering the death penalty . '' death penalty supporters acknowledge that states outside the south have been reluctant to impose the punishment , even in the face of rising big-city crime rates . `` i think the main problem is that the death penalty is not being imposed often enough in those urban jurisdictions , '' said kent scheidegger of the sacramento-based criminal justice legal foundation . `` i think people of the cities are not getting the quality of justice that people elsewhere receive . i think we need to build support for the death penalty and need to impose it more regularly where it is warranted . '' new jersey 's legislature voted last week to outlaw the death penalty -- the first state to do so in 42 years -- and gov. jon corzine signed the measure into law monday . at the same time , he commuted the sentences of the eight men on the state 's death row . the move was largely symbolic , since no executions have occurred there since 1963 . similar bills in nebraska , new mexico and montana failed this year in the legislature . state lawmakers in maryland , colorado , north carolina , tennessee and california are also considering abolishing the death penalty , but no bills have been introduced . the supreme court on january 4 will decide whether to review an appeal from louisiana inmate patrick kennedy , sentenced to death in 2003 for raping his 8-year-old stepdaughter . the state 's high court upheld the punishment as appropriate . the justices in 1976 banned capital punishment for rape , but 19 years later , louisiana passed a law allowing execution for the sexual violation of a child under 12 . state lawmakers distinguished the earlier high court case as pertaining only to `` adult women .

105	caracas , venezuela -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the price of sin rose monday in venezuela where president hugo chavez is on a campaign to make venezuelans cut back on drinking and smoking . `` everyone 's shocked , '' said leonora marino , owner of bodegon marino in valencia , venezuela , west of caracas . on monday evening , she was still changing the prices in her store as her customers looked on and complained , she told a reporter . alcohol is now 10 percent more expensive ; cigarettes are 20 percent pricier . `` really , it 's difficult to buy at these prices , '' she said , then joked , `` they say they 're going to stop eating so that they can continue drinking . '' the venezuelan government is placing a higher tax on alcohol and cigarettes in an effort to cut consumption and prevent what it views as the social , economic and moral consequences of drinking and smoking , said jose vielma mora , superintendent of seniat , the government body that oversees the collection of taxes . taxes on whiskey , brandy , cognac and other drinks that do n't come from cane sugar have been raised $ 1.79 -lrb- 3,838 bolivares -rrb- per liter , the government-run bolivarian news agency said . `` it 's unfair because , in the end , the consumer is the one who pays , '' said fernando fernandez , a liquor exporter . chavez has described whiskey as a drink for rich people , not for revolutionaries . `` we can not be spending the international reserves of this country on whiskey , '' he said . the moves represent the first steps toward transforming each venezuelan into what chavez calls `` the new man . '' chavez has cited the life of revolutionary socialist icon ernesto `` che '' guevara as an example of how to lead a more pure life . in april , chavez told a graduating class of medical students in caracas , venezuela , that the level of consumption of alcohol in the country represents a threat to public health and ought to make residents feel ashamed , according to an abn report . `` the vice causes much harm , not only to individuals , but to the collective health of the nation , '' said chavez , who said the dangers result in an increase in car wrecks and domestic violence . for his part , he has said he drinks too much coffee . also effective monday , stores near schools , churches and cultural centers will not be granted licenses to sell alcohol . taxes on cigarette imports have also increased , from 50 percent to 70 percent of the total price . on the street , some people said they do n't understand the motivations for the increase , but predicted their consumption would not change . `` the venezuelan is not going to stop drinking or smoking , '' said one person . chavez also plans to increase taxes on luxury items such as hummers , which are imported privately and at great expense . there is no hummer dealership in the country . higher oil prices in recent years have translated into higher consumption in petroleum-rich venezuela . last year , car sales increased by about 70 percent , according to the cia world factbook . but chavez , who was in cuba on monday visiting communist leader fidel castro , said he wants to focus less on material goals for venezuela 's 27 million people , 38 percent of whom live in poverty . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's flor santamaria contributed to this story .

108	durban , south africa -- india 's yuvraj singh smashed six sixes in one over as england crashed out of cricket 's world twenty20 tournament in south africa on wednesday . yuvraj singh smashes his sixth successive six off england fast bowler stuart broad . paul collingwood 's side were eliminated at the super eights stage after south africa earlier beat new zealand by six wickets in durban . england then lost by 18 runs to the singh-inspired indians , who kept their semifinal hopes alive ahead of thursday 's must-win clash with the hosts . singh reached the fastest 50 in twenty20 history , needing just 12 deliveries , as india made 218-4 . the left-hander 's six consecutive sixes in the 19th over bowled by stuart broad made him the first player to do so in twenty20 matches and just the fourth in all senior cricket . south africa 's herschelle gibbs performed the feat at the 50-over world cup in the west indies earlier this year , while sir garfield sobers and ravi shastri achieved it in first-class matches . singh 's innings ended on 58 -- from 16 balls -- when he hit a full-toss from andrew flintoff to captain collingwood at long-on from the penultimate delivery of the final over , in which he also cleared the boundary ropes once . virender sehwag top-scored with 68 off 52 balls , putting on 136 for the first wicket with gautam gambhir , who hit 58 off 41 deliveries . broad ended with the embarrassing figures of 0-60 off his four overs , while fellow seamer chris tremlett took 2-45 . in reply , england battled gamely but could only post 200-6 in their 20 overs . opener vikram solanki top-scored with 43 off 31 balls , and kevin pietersen hit 39 off 23 deliveries , but no-one could match the fireworks provided by singh . left-arm seamer irfan pathan claimed figures of 3-37 off four overs , while rudra pratap singh took 2-28 . if india can beat south africa , it would create a three-way tie and require net run-rates to decide the two teams going through . the proteas have two wins from two group e outings after beating new zealand , who have completed their super eights fixtures with two victories and a defeat . south africa restricted the black caps to 153-8 from their 20 overs on wednesday , then reached the target with five deliveries to spare as justin kemp made an unbeaten 89 . kemp was named man of the match after smashing a six off the otherwise economical mark gillespie for the winning runs . he belted six sixes and six fours in his 56-ball innings , having come to the crease in the fourth over with south africa reeling at 17-2 . kemp added 28 in four overs with gibbs -lrb- 19 -rrb- before putting on another 65 in eight overs with mark boucher . boucher departed for 23 , caught by wicketkeeper brendon mccullum off gillespie , who ended with figures of 2-11 off 3.1 overs . the experienced shaun pollock then joined kemp , and struck one six in his unbeaten 16 off 11 deliveries to help guide the proteas to their second victory . the in-form craig mcmillan top-scored for the kiwis , hitting an unbeaten 48 off only 25 balls to follow up his blistering 57 in tuesday 's five-run win against england . mccullum had put on 68 for the first wicket with lou vincent , scoring 38 before becoming the first of morne morkel 's four victims . morkel , who ended with figures of 4-17 off four overs , then removed ross taylor -lrb- 1 -rrb- two runs later and later bowled the dangerous jacob oram for a quickfire 15 . he had shane bond caught by boucher , and then almost became the first twenty20 bowler to claim five wickets when his penultimate delivery -- which clean bowled gillespie -- was declared a no-ball by umpire billy doctrove . e-mail to a friend .
109	jacksonville , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- eduardo gonzalez , a petty officer second class with the u.s. navy , is about to be deployed overseas for a third time . making his deployment even tougher is the fact his wife may not be around when he comes back . mildred and eduardo gonzalez worry about what would happen to their family if she is deported . his wife faces deportation to guatemala -- her home country that she has n't seen since 1989 . he also does n't know what would happen to his young son , eduardo jr. , if that happens . `` i like being in uniform and serving my country , but if she goes back i 'm going to have to give it all up and just get out and take care of my son and get a job , '' he said . `` defending the country that 's trying to kick my family out is a thought that always runs through my mind . '' gonzalez , who works on helicopters that bring cargo , supplies and military personnel in and out of iraq , testified before a house judiciary committee panel last month , detailing his situation and urging officials to consider some sort of policy to deal with cases like his , where military members ' families could be deported while they 're defending their country overseas . watch `` they 're tearing families apart '' '' `` i want to serve my country 100 percent . but with this issue in the back of my mind , i feel i ca n't do that , '' he testified on september 6 . the u.s. military does not have a policy to deal with such cases . each is handled case-by-case , not by the military , but by immigration authorities . the government does n't have numbers on how many military members are in predicaments similar to gonzalez 's . immigration officials also said marrying a u.s. citizen does not mean the spouse is automatically entitled to u.s. citizenship or permanent legal status . lt. col. margaret stock , a member of the u.s. army reserves who teaches immigration law at the u.s. military academy at west point , new york , said she believes there should be an overall policy dealing with the potential deportation of family members of active duty military members . `` you got to understand . when you 're in a combat zone , you need to be focusing all of your energies on fighting the enemy . you ca n't be worried that your loved ones back home could be shipped off to a foreign country where you 're never going to see them again , '' she said . stock also said the government is conflicted about how to treat such cases . on the one hand , the government is supposed to be providing military families with assistance , housing and other forms of benefits while their spouses are overseas . on the other hand , the same government is trying to deport the very same people . `` what 's happening right now is , because of the dysfunction and complexity of our immigration laws , we 've got people fighting overseas who are facing the impossible situation of having family members facing deportation back home , '' she said . in gonzalez 's case , his wife , mildred , came to the united states with her mother in 1989 when she was 5 years old . they were granted political asylum because of their status as war refugees from guatemala . in september 2000 , mildred 's mother applied for legalization and included her daughter in that application . her mother was granted legal status in july 2004 , according to gonzalez . however , six weeks earlier , gonzalez and mildred got married , canceling mildred 's ability to apply for legal status through her mother because she was no longer an unmarried daughter under the age of 21 . as a result , her legal status still remains in jeopardy . a judge in june granted her a one-year extension to remain in the united states . if her legal status does not change by june 8 , 2008 , she will have 60 days to voluntarily leave the country or face deportation . that 's just fine , according to mark krikorian , the executive director of the center for immigration studies , which lobbies for tougher laws on illegal immigration . `` what you 're talking about is amnesty for illegal immigrants who have a relative in the armed forces , and that 's just outrageous , '' he said . `` what we 're talking about here is letting lawbreakers get away with their actions just because they have a relative in the military . ... there 's no justification for that kind of policy . '' gonzalez said that type of response is unjustified . `` i 'm trying to make his country better -- my country better -- and it should be her country too . '' gonzalez himself entered the country legally , crossing the mexican border with his family when he was about 10 . he joined the navy as a so-called `` green-card sailor '' and became a u.s. citizen in july 2005 . the military does accept some immigrants who are n't u.s. citizens . `` i understand the laws have to be followed and guidelines and a system must be maintained , but on the other token , there are times when the situation is just out of their reach , '' gonzalez said . his wife , mildred , added , `` we did n't come here to break the law . we just want to feel safe and have a home just like everybody else . '' u.s. army sgt. emmanuel woko , a member of the army 's 2nd brigade , 1st infantry division who faces his third tour in iraq , understands just how gonzalez and his family feel . his wife and children could be sent back to nigeria . `` my heart is bleeding on the thought that my wife could be deported back to nigeria while i am deployed in iraq , '' he said . `` i am extremely distressed and distracted by the thought . '' that 's a sentiment echoed by gonzalez : `` we are not asking for anything . we are just asking for our families to stay with us .

' '' dye said stiles was calm and cooperative . stiles , a resident of pahrump , nevada , was turned over to las vegas metropolitan police and booked into the jail in clark county , where he had been sought in connection with the videotape , which shows a girl being sexually assaulted . the girl , who is now 7 , was found last month after a nationwide search . the tape was given to authorities by darren tuck , who told police he had found it in the desert five months before handing it over . because of the delay , during which tuck allegedly showed the tape to others , he faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography . he turned himself in to authorities in nye county , nevada , earlier this month . professionals have evaluated the girl in the videotape since she was found , and she appears to be `` healthy and fine and happy , '' her mother 's attorney said this month . the mother had not known her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until late last month , donohue said . `` a family friend called her and said , ` my god , you need to turn on the tv . i believe that is your daughter , ' '' donohue said . donohue said the mother recognized stiles , a former animal trainer . the alleged abuse most likely occurred while the mother -- a single woman working six days a week -- was at work , donohue said . another former girlfriend of stiles ' , tina allen , said this month she thinks she is the reason stiles came in contact with the girl and is `` mortified '' by the allegations against him . `` he said he 'd been in the navy and , you know , i was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what i thought they needed to be , '' allen said . allen said she took stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived . also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter , the alleged assault victim . todd allen , tina allen 's son , said he recognized his old apartment from scenes in the video . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's ed payne contributed to this report .
113	glasgow , scotland -- scottish premier league leaders celtic suffered another setback in their bid for a third successive title after being held 1-1 by managerless hibernian on saturday . david murphy 's goals have earned hibernian four points against the auld firm this season . gordon strachan 's team head the table by three points from glasgow rivals rangers , who have three games in hand ahead of sunday 's trip to aberdeen . visiting hibernian , whose manager john collins surprisingly resigned on thursday citing a lack of financial backing from the edinburgh side 's board , took the lead in the 20th minute through left-back david murphy . the englishman played a one-two with abdessalam benjelloun before crashing a shot from the edge of the box past goalkeeper mark brown and in off the crossbar . murphy 's only other goal this season came in hibs ' 1-0 win at rangers on october 6 . brown did well to keep out merouane zemmama 's audacious shot from just inside the celtic half soon after , and also tipped over brian kerr 's looping header three minutes after half-time . substitute jiri jarosik rescued celtic from a first home spl defeat this season in the 78th minute after being teed up by jan vennegoor of hesselink , who then headed against the post with two minutes to play . hibernian held on despite having to play the final few minutes with 10 men , after benjelloun was stretchered off with their three substitutes already used . the victory lifted the visitors up into fifth place , while celtic have taken just six points from the last five games . strachan , who confirmed he is hoping to sign brazilian defender coelho next month , said : `` we need to cut out the silly mistakes because if you look at some of the goals we have let in away from home this season , they are silly mistakes . `` we could have definitely done something with every one of them . i 'm happy with the number of chance we 've made in the last few weeks , but unhappy with individual mistakes . `` it 's not been great to look at , and we need to cut it out . we have honest lads walking in to the dressing room and saying , ` that was my fault .

114	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- democratic presidential candidates on wednesday criticized president bush 's plan to withdraw roughly 30,000 troops from iraq by next summer , with sen. hillary clinton labeling it `` too little , too late . '' sen. hillary clinton listens as gen. david petraeus testifies before the senate armed services committee . in an open letter to bush , clinton said the troop withdrawal `` is simply too little , too late , and unacceptable to this congress , and to the american people who have made clear their strong desire to bring our troops home , and end this war . '' bush on thursday is expected to endorse the recommendations of gen. david petraeus that the troop levels in iraq be lowered to 130,000 by july , down from the `` surge '' level of 160,000 . `` as commander in chief , you have the authority and ability to greatly accelerate the redeployment of u.s. forces from iraq , and to bring so many more troops home so much faster , '' the new york democrat said . `` i strongly urge you to choose this course of action . '' in an interview wednesday with cnn , one of clinton 's chief rivals for the 2008 nomination , sen. barack obama of illinois , said the president is returning to an earlier , failed policy . `` we now are still in the same position as we essentially were in june 2006 , '' he said . `` we are in the same levels of violence ; we are at the same levels of dysfunctional when it comes to the government in iraq , and the american people at some point have a right to ask from their leadership in washington and from the president : when is enough enough ? '' watch '08 dems weigh in on war in iraq '' obama presented a new plan for iraq on wednesday afternoon in clinton , iowa . it calls for an immediate drawdown of combat operations at a pace of one or two brigades every month , to be completed by the end of next year , according to excerpts released before his speech . a brigade comprises between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers . obama recommended a new constitutional convention for iraq , a new regional diplomatic effort and steps to confront the country 's humanitarian crisis . `` let me be clear : there is no military solution in iraq , and there never was . the best way to protect our security and to pressure iraq 's leaders to resolve their civil war is to immediately begin to remove our combat troops , '' obama said in his speech . presidential candidate john edwards , who has been pressing congressional democrats to take a more confrontational stance against president bush , called for an immediate withdrawal of 40,000 to 50,000 troops . in a prepared statement , edwards , a democrat from north carolina , said obama , clinton and republican sen. john warner of virginia , who recently called for a withdrawal to begin by christmas , have `` a moral responsibility to use every tool available to them , including a filibuster , to force the president to change course . '' edwards also called obama 's plan for troop withdrawal a copy of the president 's plan . `` sen. obama would withdraw only one to two combat brigades a month between now and the end of next year , '' said edwards , `` which for the next several months could essentially mimic the president 's own plans to withdraw 30,000 troops by next summer . '' in a statement , sen. christopher dodd , d-connecticut , said wednesday that it was useless to debate tactics when `` the underlying policy is a complete failure . '' `` i call on my colleagues to do what needs to be done to end our involvement in this civil war and help restore our national security by clearly and directly declaring that they will not support any iraq measure without a firm , enforceable deadline tied to funding for the completion of redeployment of troops from iraq , '' dodd said . democrats lack the votes in congress to force the president to bring the troops home and are seeking a compromise position . congressional democratic leaders are meeting with republican lawmakers , who want a change in war policy but are unwilling to cut funding or set a timeline for withdrawal . privately , congressional democrats concede that the next president probably will inherit at least a deployment of 100,000 troops in iraq . the democratic presidential candidates , particularly the five in congress , face pressure from liberal groups such as moveon.org demanding that they directly confront the president . obama said it was unlikely he would vote for any legislation that does not include a definite withdrawal deadline . `` you know , we are going to have to evaluate what 's available , but it appears clear to me that the president is not willing to compromise , short of congress forcing him to accept a shorter timetable , and , absent that , we are essentially engaging in a bunch of symbolic action there , '' obama told cnn . `` what we need is a clear message from the congress that it is time for us to change course , and it 's time for us to do that , '' he said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's john king , dana bash , scott anderson and xuan thai contributed to this report .

116	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- some democrats appear to be wavering on a highly contentious house resolution labeling turkey 's treatment of armenians in world war i as genocide . a kc-135 tanker lands at incirlik air base in southern turkey in 2003 . turkey , a longtime u.s. ally and nato partner , was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of armenians by ottoman turks genocide and threatened to block access to incirlik air base after the resolution passed a house committee vote . the base , in southern turkey near syria , is a major resupply center for u.s. operations in iraq and elsewhere in the mideast and asia . the pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in iraq if turkey cuts off u.s. access to the strategically important incirlik , military officials said tuesday . ankara acknowledges the killings of armenians during world war i but vehemently objects to the `` genocide '' label . the house foreign affairs committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution . house speaker nancy pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full house sometime next month . but the bush administration urged congress to drop the issue , and some leading democrats urged pelosi not to bring it to the floor . majority leader steny hoyer signaled tuesday that the vote might be put off . `` i said i thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here , '' said hoyer of maryland . `` i have not changed on that , although i would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who are revisiting their own positions . we will have to determine where everybody is . '' democratic rep. ike skelton , the chairman of the house armed services committee , announced his opposition to the resolution last week . and democratic reps. alcee hastings of florida and john tanner of tennessee , both members of the u.s. house delegation to nato , urged pelosi to reconsider in a letter released tuesday . `` more than half of the cargo flown into iraq and afghanistan comes through incirlik air base , and this base would be a key component of any plans for redeployment of our troops in the future , '' they wrote . lt. gen. carter ham , the director of operations for the joint chiefs of staff , said pentagon planners are looking at `` a broad range of options '' to keep food , fuel and ammunition flowing to u.s. troops in iraq if turkey blocks incirlik . `` we 're confident that we 'll find ways to do that , '' ham told reporters at the pentagon . `` there 's likely to be some increased cost and some other implications for that , and obviously we 'd prefer to maintain the access that we have . '' defense secretary robert gates echoed lawmakers ' concerns last week . `` about 70 percent of all air cargo going into iraq goes through turkey . ... about a third of the fuel that they consume goes through turkey or comes from turkey , '' gates said . he also said that 95 percent of the mine-resistant ambush-protective vehicles , or mraps , being deployed in iraq are flown through turkey . the vehicles are built to withstand roadside bombs . see incirlik 's key location '' the u.s. military issued a `` warning order '' a few days ago to ensure that alternative air crews , planes , fuel and routes are lined up if turkey stops or restricts u.s. access to incirlik , a source said . jordan and kuwait are among the alternatives the united states is considering . some fear pursuit of the resolution would also embolden the turks to attack kurdish rebels in northern iraq which could further complicate iraqi stability , u.s. officials said . incirlik offers 10,000 - and 9,000-foot runways and 57 hardened aircraft shelters , according globalsecurity.org , a source of background information about military issues . globalsecurity said incirlik has become a hub for cargo shipments to iraq , taking over for rhein-main air base in germany because it is closer to iraq , reducing the strain on troops and aircraft . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's barbara starr and deirdre walsh contributed to this report .
117	united nations -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the united nations is calling on nato to do more to stop the afghan opium trade after a new survey showed how the drug dominates afghanistan 's economy . afghan villagers tend to opium poppies in taliban-controlled helmand province in april 2007 . the report from the u.n. 's office on drugs and crime shows the export value of this year 's poppy harvest stood at around $ 4 billion , a 29 per cent increase over 2006 . despite afghan security forces ' efforts to curb the trade , 660 tons of heroin and morphine were trafficked out of the country in 2007 , the report said . opium is derived from poppies , and the data on cultivation was collected by examining satellite images and by assessments on the ground . the report said opium has accounted for more than half of afghanistan 's gross domestic product in 2007 . investorwords.com defines gdp as the total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time , usually a calendar year . according to the u.n. survey , about a quarter of the earnings from opium go to farmers . the rest goes to district officials who collect taxes on the crop , to drug traffickers and to the insurgents and warlords who control the trade . antonio maria costa , executive director of the u.n. office on drugs and crime , urged nato to take a more active role in countering the spread of the drug trade , which has increased dramatically since the american-led invasion to remove the hard-line islamist government of the taliban in october 2001 . `` since drugs are funding the insurgency , nato has a self-interest in supporting afghan forces in destroying drug labs , markets and convoys , '' costa said in a written statement to coincide with the release of the survey . `` destroy the drug trade and you cut off the taliban 's main funding source . '' james appathurai , a nato spokesman , said coalition forces were equally concerned by the rapid growth in the narcotics trade . `` we share the u.n. 's concerns , '' appathurai told cnn . `` drugs not only poison people , but they poison economies and governments , and it is in everyone 's interest to stop this proliferation . '' he said nato forces were providing assistance to afghan police through training and transport but he said there were no plans to deploy coalition troops to intervene directly . `` the issue of whether we can do more is certainly a live discussion for nato , but at the moment this is a matter for the afghan government , '' appathurai said . farming of opium poppies has been almost eradicated in the north and west of the country , appathurai said . however , he said , in the lawless southern provinces and especially in the taliban stronghold of helmand , poppy production was going on largely unchecked . according to the report , u.n. observers have noticed a proliferation of heroin labs in neighboring countries and along trafficking routes . costa said the labs are dependent on precursor chemicals , like acetic anhydride , that must be smuggled into the region . he called for tighter controls in chemical-producing countries and stronger intelligence-sharing between afghanistan and its neighbors . `` drug trafficking is a transnational threat , and therefore national initiatives have their limitations , '' the u.n. drug chief said . appathurai said the most effective way to curb the drug trade was tackling the insurgency head-on . he also said it was important to provide alternative work for poor afghan farmers to encourage them to give up opium production . `` you can not have eradication in isolation . if we do n't give them the support to produce alternative crops , then by wiping out their opium fields , you are only creating enemies for the future , '' he said . e-mail to a friend .

123	-lrb- realsimple.com -rrb- -- why shoes are called `` pumps '' and other strange-but-true stories behind the clothes and accessories you know and love . so , how did the trend for pointed-toe shoes start ? manolo who ? long before they ever made an appearance on the tv show `` sex and the city , '' pointed shoes were favored by polish nobles , who introduced the fashion to england on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s . the shoes , dubbed `` crackowes '' or `` poulaines '' -- after kraków , poland -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging . in 1363 the english attempted to rein in the look by law , assigning shoe spans to social classes . commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches , while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length . who invented the sports bra ? in 1977 university of vermont student lisa lindahl was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra was n't holding up . with the help of two classmates , lindahl sewed together two jock straps and -- presto ! -- the sports bra was born . the coeds founded the company jogbra a year later , garnering eternal gratitude from exercise-loving women everywhere . almost 40,000 sports bras are now sold annually . real simple : best bras for every figure . is there a real mary jane behind mary jane shoes ? not quite : the most widely held theory is that the single-strapped footwear was named for a character in `` buster brown , '' a children 's comic strip that was popular in the early 1900s . mary jane was either buster brown 's sweetheart or sister , depending on which source you consult . what 's the connection between shakespeare and raincoats ? gabardine , a water-repellent fabric invented by burberry , got its first mention from shakespeare . the bard used the word in the merchant of venice to refer to a coarse cloak worn as protection from storms . during world war i , british officers on the front lines kept warm and dry in a uniform coat made of the material -- the original burberry trench . who was the first person known to have pierced ears ? no one knows who originated the style , but there 's evidence that as early as 2500 b.c. sumerian women wore pierced earrings -- gold half-moon hoops . and guys tired of defending their diamond studs can rest easy : men have been wearing earrings since ancient egypt , where the jewelry was introduced in 1500 b.c. real simple : best way to clean jewelry . what was the inspiration for lilly pulitzer 's colorful printed dresses ? bored palm beach socialite lilly pulitzer opened a juice stand in 1959 to pass the time , but she found one drawback : the citrus concoctions discolored her clothes . she instructed her dressmaker to create a uniform that would camouflage the bright stains , and the `` lilly '' design -- sleeveless cotton shifts in vibrant prints -- was born . the style was an instant hit with customers , who soon began placing more orders for dresses than juice . how did pumps , stilettos , and sneakers get their names ? the term pump first popped up in 1550 in england , where male servants sported the style . it is said that the noise they made while wearing the loose-fitting shoes resembled the sound of a water pump . the word sneaker entered the language in the 1870s ; the rubber soles made the shoes quiet and therefore `` sneaky . '' the modern usage of stiletto , a renaissance-era italian word for an assassin 's narrow-bladed knife , made its debut in 1953 . the word turned out to be especially appropriate , because the shoes ' pointy heels were murder on wooden floors . when did folks start toting around umbrellas ? for thousands of years , in such places as egypt , china , japan , mesopotamia , and india , umbrellas were used exclusively to shade the heads of dignitaries from the broiling sun . -lrb- when it rained , the well-to-do stayed dry in covered carriages and sedan chairs . -rrb- . umbrellas were n't employed in inclement weather until the late 17th and early 18th centuries . and another hundred years passed before advances in manufacturing made them lightweight , portable , and available to average joes . have bikinis always been so popular ? hardly ! named for the nuclear-testing site bikini atoll , the suits first appeared in 1946 , but american women thought them immodest . not until the 1960s were they accepted , possibly helped by the hit song `` itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini . '' were french cuffs really created for the battlefield ? it is said that the cuffs were designed to be used as handkerchiefs in combat . but , in fact , french royalty invented the style in the 1500s , when flowing sleeves were the rage ; nobles would tie their sleeves back with fasteners . amusingly , the competitive english tried to take credit for the fashion , which to this day they refer to only as `` double cuffs . '' have women always carried purses ? once upon a time , ladies stored their essentials in a little waist sack tied under their clothing -lrb- sort of an early ancestor of the fanny pack -rrb- and accessible through slits in their skirts . around 1800 , thinner , silkier fabrics and slimmer cuts came into vogue , and women could no longer hide the bulging sacks around their midsections . the solution ? they began carrying their belongings in small pocketbooks instead . why is underwear nicknamed `` drawers '' ? in the 16th century , drawers became a common term for both men 's and women 's underpants . made of linen , the items were no-frills and looked more or less interchangeable -lrb- this being well before victoria ever had a secret ; decorative lace trim started appearing on the garments only in the middle of the 19th century -rrb- . most likely , underwear earned this distinctly unsexy epithet because it describes the way that people put on their unmentionables -- drawing them up and over the lower part of the body . real simple : get your lingerie in order e-mail to a friend . get a free trial issue of real simple - click here ! copyright 2007 time inc. . all rights reserved .
124	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- federal emergency management agency officials know the agency 's performance in the california wildfires will be watched closely for comparisons to its failures in hurricane katrina . a volunteer distributes donated food and supplies to evacueestuesday at san diego 's qualcomm stadium . fema director david paulison promised on tuesday `` a different type of response than the federal government put together for katrina . '' paulison said katrina `` was a wake-up call '' and that `` this is a new fema . '' president bush signed a federal disaster declaration wednesday , freeing up federal funds for families affected by the wildfires in seven counties in southern california . `` i will continue to make sure that our efforts are coordinated , that we are responding to the needs of people , but most importantly i want the people in southern california to know that americans all across this land care deeply about them , '' he said . the action follows an emergency declaration by bush on tuesday morning for the counties of los angeles , orange , riverside , san bernardino , san diego , santa barbara , and ventura . he said he 's `` looking forward '' to his visit to the region on thursday . according to a statement from the white house , the federal disaster declaration will allow for federal aid that `` can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs , low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses , and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster . '' fema and other relief and rescue services face significantly different challenges in the fire zone than they did on the gulf coast in 2005 . for example , the fires are n't covering every square foot of the region , as katrina did . the devastation in california is intense but not universal . during and immediately after katrina , the destruction was so complete that relief personnel and supplies -- even the u.s. army -- could not get within miles of the disaster 's epicenter , new orleans ' lower ninth ward , for several days . by contrast , roads in southern california have remained open for residents to get out and help to get in without delay . residents there are generally more affluent and are able to use their own vehicles to escape , whereas many of katrina 's victims were poor and had no means of transportation . victims in california are not stranded on rooftops without food or drinkable water , but are able travel the relatively short distances to safe places . one of those safe places is san diego 's qualcomm stadium , which is not endangered by the fires . fema and other relief agencies are able to stage supplies and meet victims ' needs in an organized way . new orleans ' superdome , on the other hand , sitting in the center of the disaster zone , was severely damaged by hurricane winds and threatened by rising water . what had been a shelter devolved into a trap . katrina also wiped out the gulf coast 's communications infrastructure , crippling the coordination of relief efforts -- even for the military . homeland security secretary michael chertoff acknowledged tuesday that the government 's response machinery had benefited from the katrina experience . `` i think there 's no question that -lsb- there were -rsb- a couple of the lessons from katrina which we have put into effect here , '' chertoff said . `` first of all , planning and preparation in advance for these kinds of challenges , so that we have worked together and planned together with the defense department and with state authorities well in advance of the crisis . that 's been a big help here , '' chertoff said . `` second , we have really flooded the zone as quickly as possible by staging assets to deal both with the firefighting issue and with the response issue , '' chertoff said . chertoff said federal officials began discussing over the weekend the need to have fema ready , `` and as we saw the evacuation issue becoming more prominent , and the number of people seeking shelter becoming more prominent , we sprang into action yesterday . `` so we 've been monitoring the situation continuously . the president 's been on top of it . we 've been on top of it . and we 're going to continue to stay ahead of this as far as we can . '' chertoff said tuesday that he had n't waited for the paperwork to be signed before staging assistance . `` we have been moving cots , blankets , other supplies into the area of san diego so that we can handle any necessity for additional sheltering capacity , '' he said . `` we 've also moved air assets to be poised to take flight when we do have the opportunity to deal with the fire , once the winds begin to die down . '' people left homeless by the fires can already go online to apply for federal help at www.fema.gov , paulison said . watch paulison discuss the `` new fema '' '' he denied suggestions similar to those made in the aftermath of katrina that the federal response was hampered because national guard equipment was in short supply because of the iraq war . `` i just have n't seen that , '' he said . the u.s. military has sent aircraft to help fight the fires , including 11 defense department helicopters equipped with water buckets and six c-130 aircraft able to drop water and flame retardant . more than 17,000 national guardsmen have been made available ; 550 marines were ready for deployment from camp pendleton , north of san diego ; and 12 defense department firefighting teams , were engaged . e-mail to a friend .

126	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the late chris benoit idolized the dynamite kid , who was half of a professional wrestling team famous in the 1980s for spectacular high-flying , acrobatic moves . chris benoit strangled his wife and suffocated his son before hanging himself in june . the dynamite kid and his partner , davey boy smith , were known as the british bulldogs . they were quick , agile and muscular , and in 1986 they won the world wrestling federation tag team championship . young benoit dreamed of wrestling like the dynamite kid , whose real name is tom billington . at the beginning of his career , benoit adopted the dynamite nickname and copied his idol 's signature moves . in june , benoit murdered his wife and young son before hanging himself . investigators found testosterone , painkillers and anti-anxiety drugs in chris benoit 's body , georgia 's chief medical examiner said a month later . when asked about benoit 's double murder-suicide , billington told cnn , `` it can make you aggressive , the steroids . but personally i would n't , you know , kill no bleeding kid , or wife either . '' billington now lives in a public housing apartment outside manchester , england . he has lost the use of his legs . a pin sticks out from one of his toes . billington blames his wrestling life for doing this to him -- wrestling and the fact that he ignored doctors who told him to stop the punishment to his body . and from the steroids , he said . billington told cnn that the steroids came from doctors , from friends , even from steroids meant for horses . he took them all , took a terrible pounding in the ring , and like his partner -lrb- who died at age 39 in 2002 -rrb- , began taking extensive amounts of painkillers . benoit 's death has refocused a media spotlight on the organization for which he wrestled , now known as world wrestling entertainment , and the man who has ruled wrestling for years , chairman of the board vince mcmahon . mcmahon , appearing with linda mcmahon , his wife and wwe ceo , told cnn : `` nothing from the wwe , under any set of circumstances had anything to do with chris benoit murdering his family . how did we know chris benoit would turn into a monster . '' read a full transcript of the mcmahons interview . vince mcmahon defended the organization , saying its drug-testing policy was not just for show . `` our policy stacks up just as well as anyone else 's in sport , although again emphasizing we are entertainment , and no one in entertainment , no one has this kind of wellness policy , '' mcmahon said . critics say mcmahon pushes his stars and non-stars , works them too many nights per year and has encouraged the large physiques prevalent in modern wrestling . they say mcmahon only looks at his employees as commodities , pawns in a huge business . his businesses are quite successful . about 16 million people a week tune into wwe tv shows . two of their cable programs -- `` raw '' and `` friday night smackdown '' -- are weekly ratings giants . pay-per-view specials generate an average of $ 100 million per year . when asked about the high number of former wrestlers who had died before they turned 50 years old , vince mcmahon said each person in the wwe bore responsibility for their own lives -- especially outside the arena . `` if someone passes through our organization , it is not our responsibility for someone 's personal activities , '' he said . he also said there is n't `` any organization in the world , be it entertainment or be it sport , that can tell you that they are totally drug-free . '' watch as a wwe wrestler says the perception of steroid use is wrong '' the mcmahons said the wwe is taking steps toward improving its oversight of its athletes . since the newest wwe drug screening program began in february 2006 , more than 30 of the organization 's wrestlers have been suspended , including two since cnn 's interview with the mcmahons . david black -- who helped the nfl develop its drug program and now runs tests for the wwe -- says twice that number have tested positive and been given a warning . but dr. gary wadler , a world-renowned expert in the study of drugs and athletes , says the wwe is not doing enough . `` it certainly falls far , far short of where it needs to be , '' he said . `` and there is a gold standard , and i measure all these sporting and entertainment activities against this gold standard . and -lsb- the wwe is -rsb- miles apart . '' wadler , a longtime critic of mcmahon , was referring to the u.s. anti-doping agency in colorado springs , colorado . u.s. athletes training for the olympics are randomly tested and , if caught just once , face a two-year suspension from competition . if caught a second time , they can be banned for life . black 's programs test wrestlers four times a year . the first is a `` baseline '' test , according to the wwe . black then tests for `` nonmedical '' uses , meaning that if an athlete has a prescription , he is cleared . `` it 's just a loophole that in my mind guts the entire program , '' said travis tygart , who heads the u.s. anti-doping agency . mcmahon denies that his wrestlers are pushed to use steroids . he says the average wrestler is lighter than in recent years . watch one of the new wwe stars talk about being `` straight edge '' '' `` there 's an expression in our business , that here is where you make your money . it 's your face , it 's what you do with it , '' he said . `` it 's your personality , it 's what you do with it . it 's your delivery , your elocution . it 's storyline , it 's things , all those things that are theatrical as well as athletic in the ring .

127	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- everyone goes through a rebellious phase . and , if you 're lucky , you 'll be able to look back on those years and laugh . if you 're less lucky , you spent those years on a reality show , so for the rest of time , millions of strangers can look back on them and laugh instead . in modern times , cats frolic among the ruins of ancient rome . but , hey , it could be worse . you could be responsible for the fall of western civilization , just like justa grata honoria , the roman princess whose wild ways and -lrb- literally -rrb- naked ambition set off a chain reaction that culminated in the destruction of the roman empire . barely regal . smart , conniving , and ruthless , honoria possessed all the attributes befitting a roman emperor , except for that pesky y chromosome . as a young girl , she watched as her dimwitted six-year-old brother , valentinian iii , was crowned emperor of the western roman empire , while she was set aside to await a suitable marriage . hardly content to lead a quiet and chaste life , honoria rebelled with aplomb , sleeping her way through the royal court while still in her teens . although her after-hours habits caused quite the scandal , they failed to satiate her need for attention and power , so honoria set her eyes on the throne . employing her ample charms , she seduced her brother 's royal chamberlain , eugenius , and together , they plotted to murder valentinian and seize power . but , alas , their scheme was soon exposed . eugenius was executed , and honoria was sent to a convent in constantinople . life as a nun was a fate worse than death for honoria , but even that could n't quell her ambition . she spent her years at the nunnery plotting one escape attempt after another . finally , out of sheer desperation , she turned to sources outside the empire . her savior would have to be powerful enough to defy valentinian and risk open war with rome . only one man fit that description : attila , king of the huns . attila the hubby . honoria got the barbarian 's attention with a mutually beneficial proposal : if attila would rescue her , she would marry him , and he would get half of the western empire as her dowry . of course , honoria was in no position to rightfully offer any portion of the roman empire . but she was betting that after marrying her , attila would conquer the whole empire , and she 'd become queen to boot . attila had secretly been planning a move against rome for years , and honoria 's letter gave him the perfect opportunity to strike . wasting no time , he told valentinian that he planned to marry honoria , and demanded the dowry he 'd been promised . naturally , valentinian refused , and attila used his status as a `` wronged husband '' to invade roman territory in 451 c.e. . the hun armies quickly swept through the empire , destroying everything in their path , and eventually they arrived in rome . like all the other cities before it , rome would also have been annihilated were it not for the famine and disease that devastated the huns during the invasion . rome survived attila 's assault with the unlikely help of another nomadic enemy tribe , the visigoths , but the western empire never recovered . within a generation , the armies of the goths , franks , and huns had overrun the area . the princess bride . ultimately , honoria became neither roman empress nor a hun queen . attila never rescued her , and she was eventually sent back to rome and left to her brother 's justice . not wanting to cause a scandal by having her executed , and unwilling to send her back into exile where she could scheme again , valentinian settled on a suitable third option . after years of struggle , honoria finally suffered the fate she had been dreading all along : she was married off to an elderly roman senator , and the rest of her life went unrecorded by history . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .
128	atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- i was 14 at the time . lebanon 's civil war was in full flood . one afternoon the shells began raining down on our neighborhood in beirut . a lebanese woman and her son run through west beirut in 1989 during fighting between rival forces . we ran from school screaming . forget the book bags , classmates , homework . just run . out of breath , my knees giving way , it seemed to take forever to reach our local shelter -- a dark humid room at the back of our apartment block . the memory of that terrifying afternoon receded -- until recently . after more than a decade of relative peace and reconstruction , the bombings and assassinations have returned to beirut . every time i hear of a new explosion , i think of a frightened child sitting in darkness . in 1988 , i watched the last throes of lebanon 's civil war firsthand -- and like millions of lebanese , sad , frustrated and often fearful . see a timeline of lebanon 's recent history '' now i watch from another continent , but i find those same emotions resurfacing . the conspiracies , the car bombs , the threatening rhetoric and political deadlock are eerily familiar . the actors are like shadows from a long gone past . they are grayer perhaps -- those who have avoided assassination . but the cast in lebanon 's tragedy has changed little in two decades . then , as now , a presidential election is the setting , and the struggle where religion and clan play the main roles threatens to set lebanon back 20 years . see bios of lebanon 's major players '' in 1988 , the president 's term was coming to an end and the warring factions were unable to agree on a new candidate . militias prevented parliament members from reaching the assembly building . compromise was nowhere in sight . the west had abandoned lebanon to the manipulation of its neighbors . syria had its choice for president ; israel had its own allies -- a foil for growing muslim radicalism . the country was awash with weapons . in his last act as president , amin gemayel named fellow christian and army chief michel aoun as prime minister . at a stroke , he shattered the convention that a muslim hold that position . muslims refused to serve in the cabinet and the country ended up with two governments . aoun famously declared : `` i am prime minister and six ministers in one . '' aoun 's `` war of liberation '' against syria turned into defeat . then , he turned on fellow christians of the lebanese forces in the `` war of elimination . '' when that failed , the syrians drove aoun to take refuge at the french embassy . in august 1990 , i came to cnn as a world report panelist . i tried to explain lebanon 's chaos , the bewildering array of factions and the horrors of civil war for ordinary civilians . i had seen people killed in front of me ; children orphaned in seconds , parents burying their infants in oversize white coffins . so when i was offered the opportunity to stay at cnn , i gratefully accepted the chance to escape the anarchy . but almost as i left , the civil war was being laid to rest . the various factions had fought each other to a standstill ; arab governments , supported by the west , helped negotiate a new constitutional framework overseen by syrian influence . peace came to lebanon , but it would be five years before i returned . in 1995 , i went back and was stunned . i kept looking around for checkpoints manned by militants . i could n't believe that i could go anywhere without being harassed or kidnapped by one faction or another . no longer did identity -- christian , muslim or druze -- define where lebanese could go . people mixed freely in chic coffee shops and smoked the hubble-bubble , laughing at the same jokes . it was as if lebanon 's divisions had been wiped away by some magic eraser . downtown beirut , once rocked by explosions and pitted with bullet holes , was rocking to lebanese pop music . the dusty sandbags had given way to boutiques carrying the latest european fashions and deluxe hotels . lovers had returned to beirut 's corniche , overlooking the mediterranean , for romantic strolls at sunset . but the agreement that ended the civil war was more a truce than a real settlement -- and was overseen by a `` pax syriana . '' as anti-syrian sentiment grew , so did political tensions . on valentine 's day 2005 , the corniche was once again rocked by an explosion . former prime minister rafik hariri was killed . the symbolism left me speechless . on the day of love , lebanon was thrown back into its most hateful history . it had been widely expected that hariri would run for office again and demand the withdrawal of syrian troops . suspicion fell on damascus , which vehemently denied involvement . on march 14 , martyrs ' square became a human sea of demonstrators : muslims , druze and christians alike , demanding the `` truth . '' but hariri 's death also exposed the fault lines that had broken lebanon a generation previously . even after it withdrew its troops , syria still had allies in lebanon . one was hezbollah , accused of the suicide attacks that had killed scores of u.s. marines in beirut more than 20 years previously . another was gen. michel aoun ; now back from exile , the same michel aoun who had defied syria in 1989 , but who now made common cause with hezbollah against his fellow christians . earlier this year i visited martyrs ' square . the spirit of the cedar revolution had evaporated . the place looked like a morgue . anti-government hezbollah squatters had brought life there to a standstill . as i passed through , business owners stood silent in the sun and shook their heads at me in despair . i wondered if they sensed my disappointment , my pain at watching beirut bleed again . lebanon 's political actors now find themselves re-enacting scenes from the final act of the civil war 19 years ago . once again , the term of the president is approaching its end ; there is no agreement on his successor . suspicion and fear are the political currency of the day . and the questions haunts me : will the country 's brief renaissance that so amazed me in 1995 be snuffed out by the old curse of sectarian rivalries ? e-mail to a friend . cnn 's joe sterling , david ariosto , saad abedine and tracy doueiry contributed to this report .

'' watch a report on reactions to the verdict '' the foreign office said gibbons would be given credit for the four days since her arrest , meaning that the she has 11 days remaining on her sentence . earlier , miliband had met with siddig , who was summoned to the foreign office in london . `` i explained to him that we were very concerned by the case . we believe that this was an innocent misunderstanding , '' miliband said in a statement released thursday after the meeting . `` the sudanese ambassador undertook to ensure our concerns were relayed to khartoum at the highest level . he also said he would reflect back to khartoum the real respect for the islamic religion in this country , '' the statement added . on the first floor of the courthouse , around 25 police linked arms and forced journalists and british officials away from the court entrance . police detained some journalists , and confiscated a camera belonging to a freelance cnn cameraman . four vans filled with riot police were waiting outside the courthouse , but there were no signs of street disturbances or protests . staff from gibbons ' school , including robert boulos , the head of unity high school , were present . the staff members refused to comment on their colleague 's predicament . on wednesday , boulos said he was `` horrified '' when he found out that the complaint about the naming of the bear came from a member of his own staff -- not from a parent , as originally thought . defense counsel later confirmed that the complaint came from sarah khawad , a secretary at the school . gibbons has been working at the school -- popular with wealthy sudanese and expatriates -- since august , after leaving her position as deputy head teacher at a primary school in liverpool , england , this summer , boulos said . he said gibbons asked the children to pick their favorite name for the new class mascot , which she was using to aid lessons about animals and their habitats . e-mail to a friend . journalist andrew heavens contributed to this report . copyright 2007 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .
137	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- if you thought it was difficult managing your own money in 2007 , consider the pressure of the task when you 're dealing with $ 1.8 trillion of client assets . sallie krawcheck has made fortune 's list of the world 's most powerful women every year since 2002 . that 's what sallie krawcheck does as chairman and chief executive of citi global wealth management . she joined the banking industry as a research analyst , but quickly rose through the ranks , gaining a reputation for honesty and integrity along the way . dubbed the `` mrs clean '' of wall street , ms krawcheck was credited with restoring investors ' faith in analyst reports while head of retail brokerage firm smith barney . she joined citigroup in 2002 , and spent some time as chief financial officer before taking up her current role in march 2007 . sallie krawcheck has been a regular entrant on fortune 's list of the world 's most powerful women in business -- in 2007 , she made number 12 . john defterios caught up with ms krawcheck in dubai . he asked her for her views on the movement of capital outside the g8 -lrb- canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia , the united kingdom and the united states -rrb- . sallie krawcheck -lrb- sk -rrb- : i think what 's happening right now , it 's fascinating because in the united states and in developed europe we 're having a liquidity crunch -- someone might argue a liquidity crisis . and in fact , we are awash with liquidity in the middle east and in asia as well , so there 's really a bifurcation that 's occurring in the world . and if you think about , oil does n't even have to stay at the 90-plus dollar level it is ; even at levels in the 70 's , 60 's , 50 's , 40 's , a tremendous amount of liquidity is being generated in these markets which is really being put back into the market . yes , the investments are going up globally , but the governments here really are investing back in the infrastructure and the economies of this region . and so over time , you 're really going to see ... i think continue to see ... a shift in economic activity on a relative basis from the more developed economies here to the middle east as well as to asia . john defterios -lrb- jd -rrb- : it 's coming almost as a perfect storm ; we have a sub prime crisis , a 20 percent fall in the dollar in the last two years . in this window of time , is there a danger that the financial capitals build outside of wall street and it undermines its role ? -lrb- sk -rrb- : i think there is no doubt that new york is losing its status as a financial capital of the world . if you think about some years ago , if you think about the internet bubble for example , where it was new york and california was n't it ? and you look at a whole range of reasons for it , and the sub prime crisis perhaps , the decline of the dollar perhaps . but you have overlapping regulators in the united states , you have very high taxes in the united states , you have a very litigious environment in the united states , and you have the emerging markets coming up , so capital is being raised outside of the united states . these things , some of which are negative for the united states , some of which are positive for the other regions , is accelerating a shift that was underway from new york , to london , to hong kong , to singapore , and potentially to dubai as well . -lrb- jd -rrb- : some of the wealth funds are now on the radar of both wall street and capitol hill in washington . you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . you ca n't say i want some of that liquidity but i only want part of that liquidity . what is the result of that do you think ? can you over-regulate the sovereign funds ? -lrb- sk -rrb- : oh , i think you can over-regulate the sovereign funds . i think the same question can be asked of the private equity funds and the hedge funds as well ; where in a lot of countries the regulators have been struggling with the issue of ` here are very important drivers of global markets and global liquidity ' . and the concern is if , gee these are going to be important going forward , we want to have these involved in our economy and our markets , but if we regulate this alone that money will skitter away to another market -- to a market outside the united states or europe for example . -lrb- jd -rrb- : it 's fascinating because if you look at qatar or egypt or shanghai , the stock markets have almost had like a one way path ; there 's been some correction here in the middle east . but what are we likely to see here , stair steps up the ladder with some corrections along the way , or an implosion because of the rapid gains ? -lrb- sk -rrb- : i think you 've got to separate the idea of what 's going on in the real economies and what 's going on in the market places . they move together , but sometimes they separate , they diverge , and they can diverge for a long period of time . if you look at economic growth potential of the middle east , of asia , of latin america , we feel very bullish about this . and i was making the point earlier today , china has been growing at 11 or 12 percent , not for one year or two years , but literally for 30 years . for 30 years it 's been growing at that kind of rate and really can continue as far as the eye can see . so , say the same thing for the middle east , the growth even at a lower oil price can be significant , but can be high single digit or double digit for some foreseeable period going forward . -lrb- jd -rrb- : is wall street , or for that matter , london or any other financial center ready for a woman -- for example in your case , 1.4 trillion dollars of assets ... -lrb- sk -rrb- : 1.8 thank you ... -lrb- jd -rrb- : ... to run one of the major money center banks of the world ? i 'm sure you 're feeling this pressure even though you 're young by international standards . are we ready for a woman to take over a money center bank ? -lrb- sk -rrb- : well it looks like the united states may be ready for a woman to take over as president . so i think if we 're ready to potentially have a woman run the country , i think we are getting ready as a country , to potentially have a woman run a money center bank . now , you know , the board would n't ask and i would n't accept , but if you look across wall street , there are a few women who are putting themselves in positions to be successors the next time there are ceo 's who move along , and i think it 's a very exciting development for the industry and for the country . have your say . email us at mme@cnn.com, or send an i-report . e-mail to a friend .
138	editor 's note : ann curley is the assignment manager for the cnn medical news unit . she has been a type i diabetic for 40 years . this is her story of life with diabetes . ann curley uses a pump attached to a catheter in her body to monitor glucose levels and administer insulin . -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- when i was 7 years old , my mom took me to the doctor because i had lost a lot of weight , despite a voracious appetite . my family had just moved from the san francisco bay area to pasadena , california , and this visit to the doctor 's office was my introduction to a man who would come to have a huge impact on my life . his name was dr. robert deputy , and he was the pediatrician who diagnosed me with diabetes . he spoke to me directly , rather than to my mother , and he asked me questions : did i feel thirsty ? did i need to urinate during the night ? the answer to both questions was yes . he asked for a urine sample and the result was immediate . dr. deputy told me and my mother that my body was n't processing sugar properly . i had diabetes . that is how my 40-year journey with diabetes began . i was checked into a hospital to learn how to test my urine for sugar , give myself injections of insulin , follow a diabetic diet and control my diabetes . i spent several days in the hospital learning how to manage my disease , and then they sent me home . dr. deputy would call our house each afternoon to check on me and see how i was doing . much to my parents ' chagrin -- and to my delight -- he wanted me to be self sufficient and responsible for monitoring myself . i refused to let my parents give me injections or test my urine . this demand for self sufficiency turned out to be one of my best life lessons , and not just for managing my diabetes . while some diabetics may feel their disease is a burden , i feel that being diagnosed with diabetes was a blessing in disguise . it forced our family to eat healthily , and it taught me about good nutrition -- something i practice every day . i know carbohydrate counts in most foods , and i understand dietary concepts that most people do n't even care about . being active is also a way to burn off high blood sugar , so when my urine tested positive for glucose , my older sister robin was in charge of exercising me . we had countless jump-rope contests , bike rides and roller-skating excursions , keeping me and my three sisters active and fit . and i felt like a little mad scientist , using a test tube with drops of water , urine and fizzy tablets to see if there was sugar in my urine . fortunately , over time , technology improved . first , test strips were developed that could be dipped in urine to reveal whether sugar was present in it . but the truth is , testing urine for sugar was a primitive method . by the time sugar gets into the urine , it 's a signal that the body does n't have enough insulin to process sugar . and the urine test did n't give an actual number for the amount of sugar in the urine . it simply gave a color reading that corresponded with a range of how much sugar was present in the urine . inaccurate was really an understatement when you talk about urine testing . home blood glucose testing kits became available in the early 1980s , and they were a huge move toward precise control and management of diabetes . with the kit , the diabetic uses a device to poke a finger and produce a drop of blood . the blood is placed on a test strip that fits into a device that produces a reading of the blood glucose within seconds . while i initially balked at the idea of pricking my finger several times a day , now i ca n't imagine not doing it in order to monitor what my blood sugar is doing . the 1980s also saw the advent of the insulin pump . this device is the size of a pager and contains a reservoir filled with insulin . the reservoir connects to a tube that infuses the insulin into the body with a tiny plastic shunt . so rather than taking multiple injections to mimic the body 's insulin patterns , the pump drips insulin into the body to keep blood sugars constant , then gives extra amounts with meals . another life-altering development in diabetes , which i have discovered in the last year , is the continuous glucose monitor , or cgm . this is a small device inserted into the tissue -- usually the abdomen , hip or leg -- and it has a tiny sensor that reads the glucose level of the body 's fluids . the data is transmitted to a receiver , and patients can see a constant reading of their blood sugar levels . i have participated in clinical trials for three different cgm devices , and i found them all to be quite accurate . some sensors transmit data directly to an insulin pump , so you can use the reading to adjust and fine-tune the amount of insulin being pumped into the body . the patient still has to test his or her blood sugar to confirm the sensor is properly calibrated , but it 's amazing to be able to see constant readings and graphs of what your blood sugar is doing and better manage blood sugars . cgm technology is a step toward the ultimate goal of controlling type i diabetes using what 's called a `` closed loop system . '' this means diabetics someday will be able to wear a pump that gathers data from a sensor so precise that the pump can be programmed to act on its own and make adjustments all by itself . the current systems are `` open looped , '' meaning the diabetic controls when the doses are given . the goal is to eventually create a pump that is more like a robotic delivery system , and all the patient has to do is wear it . once that technology is perfected , this type of device would be implanted , which would be the next best thing to not having diabetes . i mentioned to my sister robin that i had tracked down dr. deputy for this article . she told me something i did n't know when i was 7 . forty years ago , before the advent of all of the cool diabetes technology such as insulin pumps , continuous glucose monitors and blood sugar testing , parents were given a fairly grim prediction for how their child would fare . dr. deputy told my parents that i would probably only live to the age of 20 or 30 , which apparently -- but not surprisingly -- had the whole family freaked out . i spoke with dr. deputy , who recently retired from his pediatric practice , and he seemed to remember me . when i asked him about his dismal prognosis for my survival , he said sadly , `` at that time , that was what we told parents back then . ... everything changes with time -- diabetes , leukemia -- technology has changed with the pump and the equipment . '' i think he was relieved that his prognosis was wrong . i know that i certainly am . in fact , i am hoping to live another 40 years ! e-mail to a friend .

142	columbia , south carolina -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- democratic sen. barack obama kicked off a series of local outreach gospel concerts friday in charleston , south carolina , that unexpectedly came back to bite his campaign . democratic presidential hopeful barack obama is competing for the black vote with hillary clinton . the concerts were meant to boost black voters ' support for his presidential nominee bid -- the kind of events that would normally fly under the national radar . the ensuing controversy highlighted that obama 's desire to unite disparate voting blocs -- especially religious voters -- under his umbrella of `` change '' is not without some serious pitfalls . when the campaign announced the lineups for the three-city `` embrace the change ! '' gospel tour last week , one name stood out to gay bloggers : donnie mcclurkin . the grammy-award winning singer is on record as saying homosexuality is a choice , and that he was `` once involved with those desires and those thoughts '' but was able to get past them through prayer . to say the least , neither of those arguments is very popular in the gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender community . john aravosis , a prominent gay blogger and co-founder of the web site americablog , led the charge against the obama campaign , writing that the illinois democrat was `` sucking up to anti-gay bigots '' and `` giving them a stage . '' when the story bubbled up into the mainstream media , it took the obama campaign by surprise . obama 's efforts in the palmetto state have overwhelmingly targeted african-american churchgoers in a bid to win over black voters in south carolina from rival sen. hillary clinton . the campaign has vigorously promoted the candidate 's faith , launching `` 40 days of faith and family '' in september , which used bible study groups to tap into the black electorate . campaigners have run three radio ads , one of which called obama a `` christian family man , '' that aired on gospel stations across the state . earlier this month , obama spoke at an evangelical church in the traditionally conservative city of greenville , where he demonstrated a casual familiarity with christian vocabulary , telling the crowd , to much applause , that `` i am confident that we can create a kingdom right here on earth . '' after that appearance , the obama campaign told cnn that republicans no longer had a choke hold on issues of faith and values . `` i think that what you 're seeing is a breaking down of the sharp divisions that existed maybe during the '90s , '' obama said . `` at least in politics , the perception was that the democrats were fearful of talking about faith , and on the other hand you had the republicans who had a particular brand of faith that oftentimes seemed intolerant or pushed people away . '' but on tuesday , obama was forced to confront the uncomfortable truth that some christians and gays are a little more than just strange bedfellows , especially among blacks . obama issued a statement saying , `` i strongly disagree with reverend -lsb- donnie -rsb- mcclurkin 's views and will continue to fight for these rights as president of the united states , '' and argued that it is important to confront homophobia among religious african americans . a september poll of african americans in south carolina by winthrop university and etv showed that 62 percent of those surveyed said that `` sex between two adults of the same sex '' is `` strongly unacceptable . '' obama held a conference call wednesday with joe solomonese , president of the human rights campaign , and announced that the rev. andy sidden , an openly gay south carolina pastor , will appear at the same event as mcclurkin on sunday in columbia . solomonese was not completely assuaged . `` i spoke with senator barack obama today and expressed to him our community 's disappointment for his decision to continue to remain associated with reverend mcclurkin , an anti-gay preacher who states the need to ` break the curse of homosexuality , ' '' he said in a statement . `` there is no gospel in donnie mcclurkin 's message for gay , lesbian , bisexual and transgender people and their allies . that 's a message that certainly does n't belong on any presidential candidate 's stage . '' the state newspaper in columbia reported friday that obama organized a conference call thursday night with gay and lesbian leaders . after the call , the south carolina gay and lesbian pride movement announced it will hold a protest vigil outside sunday 's concert in columbia . privately , obama aides say they believe obama is a candidate of real , transformational change , and that uproars like the mcclurkin controversy are necessary speed bumps on the road to bringing people with opposing viewpoints together to air their differences . will obama 's refusal to kick mcclurkin off the concert bill hurt him ? like many political squabbles , despite the national story , it depends how much the controversy resonates with voters in those crucial early states : iowa , new hampshire , nevada and south carolina . and in south carolina , where african americans make up about half of democratic primary-goers , voters might not have a problem with mcclurkin at all . e-mail to a friend .

144	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- state department officials should serve where they are needed -- even in war-torn iraq , u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice said friday . u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice says that `` people need to serve where they are needed . '' rice was responding to foreign service officers ' objections to the possibility of `` directed assignments '' in iraq . the issue has caused an uproar in the state department , resulting in a contentious town hall-style meeting wednesday . the new directives would be needed if enough qualified foreign service officers do n't step forward to fill open positions at the u.s. embassy in baghdad . if the state department enforces directed assignments , it will be the first time since the vietnam war era . one official called the order to serve in iraq `` a potential death sentence '' during the town meeting . the state department already has begun notifying about 200 people considered prime candidates . those chosen will be given 10 days to respond , according to last week 's announcement . unless they have a valid medical reason to refuse , those who decline could face dismissal , it said . wednesday 's heated meeting was replayed on an internal state department television channel in washington several times and talked about widely . some at the hourlong meeting questioned why they were not told of the policy change directly , learning about it instead from news organizations last week . watch the diplomats exchange angry words '' `` i just have no respect for the whole process because you 've demonstrated a lack of respect for your own colleagues , '' said foreign service officer jack croddy . `` thank you for that comment . it 's full of inaccuracies , but that 's ok , '' harry thomas jr. , director general of the foreign service , shot back . others pointed out the risks of such assignments , considering the dangers of a war zone , lack of security and regular rocket attacks on u.s. personnel . rice , who did not attend the meeting , tried to calm things down friday by underscoring the state department 's attempts to do `` everything that we can to try and protect our diplomats . '' however , she said , `` this is one of the highest priority tasks of the united states , and we 're going to meet our obligations . '' speaking to reporters en route to turkey and the mideast , she said , `` i do n't know if we will have direct assignments or not , but we are one foreign service , and people need to serve where they are needed .

147	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it was two years late and billions of dollars over budget , but this week the singapore airline-owned a380 completed its maiden passenger journey between singapore and sydney . making history : the first double bed on a commercial jet . on board were nearly 500 passengers who had bid thousands of dollars for the historical experience . this was a turning point in aviation history as airbus ' superjumbo became the world 's largest aircraft . and the time had finally come for it to receive some admiration . singapore airlines ' ceo , chew choon seng named the jetliner the `` queen of the skies '' . tom enders , ceo of airbus said he would like to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary on one of its double beds . and cnn 's richard quest , who was on board the maiden flight , said there was `` nothing quite like it '' . the luxury on board , he said , sets a new standard for air travel . it 's the quietest large passenger jet ever built -lrb- inside and out -rrb- , it has a low fuel-burn to reduce fuel use and emissions , it can carry 40 percent more passengers than other large aircraft and in greater comfort . but the feature that has attracted greatest interest on the singapore airlines a380 is its '' beyond first class '' cabins . behind the sliding doors of the singapore airlines suites , the well-heeled can luxuriate in a private cabin designed by leading french yacht designer , jean-jacques coste . there 's a wide leather seat and alongside that , a standalone bed . this is two meters long with givenchy duvets and cushions . and for couples traveling , the beds on the middle two suites can be converted into double beds . from bed or chair , travelers can catch a movie on a 23-inch widescreen lcd . laptops can be plugged into an in-seat power supply and business travelers with just a thumb drive can plug this into a usb ports and access a suite of office tools on singapore airlines ' in-flight entertainment system . celebrity chefs including britain 's gordon ramsay and georges blanc were behind the first class menu that can be eaten off givenchy tableware . unlike other airlines , that have considered offering casinos , gyms and showers on their future a380s , singapore airlines has opted instead for a configuration that , whilst offering luxury , also makes money . as chew choon seng , ceo of singapore airlines reminded reporters last week , the first boeing 747s soon ditched the lounges and bars on the upper decks in favor of seats that could generate cash . behind the 12 luxury suites there are 399 economy seats , ranked 10-abreast on the upper and lower decks , as well as 60 business class seats that are the biggest yet at 87 centimeters wide . singapore airlines has ordered 19 superjumbos for an estimated price tag of $ 5.7 billion . the second is due to arrive next february with further deliveries later in 2008 . tickets for the a380 's first return commercial flight between singapore and sydney were sold at auction on ebay . one passenger paid $ 100,000 for the experience , with the majority paying between $ 1,500 and $ 5,000 . the $ 1.4 million raised has gone to charities in singapore , sydney and a global humanitarian organization . from sunday 28 october , singapore airlines will commence its scheduled service between singapore and sydney on one of the three daily flights in each direction . the jetliner to be delivered next spring will be used on one of the three daily flights between singapore and london 's heathrow airport . it 's been a long road to this point for airbus , but the journey is by no means over . the airline has a tough delivery schedule ahead to fulfil its 185 orders to 15 customers -lrb- see figures below -rrb- . next year it plans to deliver 13 , a further 25 in 2009 and 45 in 2010 . tom enders , airbus ' ceo does n't underestimate the scale of challenge ahead . `` this is not a piece of cake , '' he told cnn , `` but we have learned our lessons and we are very confident today that we can deliver to our customers . '' it has n't just been airbus that has been frantically preparing for the a380 launch . airports around the world have had to make changes to runways and gates , as well as buy in new vehicles that can tow the giant aircraft and lift high enough to its upper decks . seventy airports are now ready , airbus has said . singapore 's changi airport , home to the singapore airlines a380 fleet , was the first , and when its new terminal 3 opens early next year , 19 gates across the three terminals will be a380-ready with aerobridge access to both decks . heathrow 's new terminal 5 will be able to handle four a380s at one time . british airways , the terminal 's sole occupant , recently confirmed an order for 12 superjumbos and it now wants baa to upgrade a satellite building to be built next to terminal 5 to accommodate them . as willie walsh , ba 's ceo told cnn , `` we want to make sure that development is built with the a380 in mind . '' but whether the arrival of the a380 sets a standard for future air travel is still undecided . as cnn 's richard quest points out , while these giant airplanes may be suitable for getting large numbers of people between key destinations quickly , demand could be even higher for the medium-size jets such as boeing 's up-coming 787 dreamliner . as richard quest says , `` there 's no doubt the a380 will sell , but it is going to take a long time to reach the 420 sales which is the amount airbus needs to make money .

149	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- if someone had asked kelly pless to describe herself three years ago , the word `` fit '' would have never crossed her mind . kelly pless weighed 220 pounds at her heaviest . she lost 95 pounds through diet and exercise . for most of her adult life , the 31-year-old graduate student from sunny isles beach , florida , has struggled with her weight . she started gaining as a teenager and by the time she graduated from high school , she was carrying 215 pounds on her 5 ' 2 '' frame . prom , she says , was a nightmare . `` i had to go to three different stores to buy a dress , '' pless said . `` i had to buy the biggest , also the ugliest , prom dress the store had because it was the only one that would fit . '' after high school , she lost 50 pounds . but because she had n't done it in a healthy way , her weight crept back up to 220 pounds . at 28 , she started having trouble breathing and doctors told her the weight was to blame . she reached her breaking point . `` i remember being heavy and feeling like being fit just was n't something i could be , '' said pless . `` i remember feeling like even if i tried , it was n't something my body was capable of . '' despite her doubts , pless decided to do something . fortunately she did n't have to look far for inspiration . see before and after weight loss photos from cnn.com i-reporters '' `` my manager at the kennedy space center ran marathons , and he was the same age as my father , '' she said . because her own father had diabetes and was in poor health , he seemed much older , she said . over the next three to four months , she began walking , without any real goal or expectation . pless believed that if she just focused on eating less and moving more , everything would fall into place . `` at first , it was hard to start exercising because i was worried people would make fun of me , '' pless said . `` but then i just told myself , if that 's the worst that could happen ... i just got out there and did n't care . '' eventually , she started to run or `` shuffle '' as she jokingly recalls . she also adopted an `` eat to live '' philosophy and satisfied her cravings for sweets by eating lots of fruit . `` i changed how i felt about food and what it meant to me , '' said pless , who occasionally indulges in a bite of birthday cake or a piece of chocolate . `` one of the first things i cut out was cakes and cookies . that was my weak spot . after a few months of cutting those things out , i focused more on portion control , '' said pless . `` i pretty much eat when i 'm hungry and do n't eat when i 'm not and really try to pay attention to when those times are . make sure i 'm not eating out of boredom or -lsb- at -rsb- social events , i try to make sure i 'm not overeating , just because everyone else is . '' kelly pless shares her weight loss secrets '' pless pays close attention to societal pressure , which she believes is the reason many people overeat . restaurant servings are about three times bigger than a normal portion size , she says . she makes sure she does n't overeat when dining out simply because the food is there . `` what 's hard is to change how you feel about foods that you love or that are n't necessarily good for you , or actually change how you look at food . that was the hardest part for me .

'' all of the hard work and determination paid off . pless has lost 95 pounds and kept it off for 1 1/2 years . as a result , she says , she 's healthier and more confident . she 's also set a new professional goal -- to pursue a doctorate in food and exercise psychology -- so she can help others who are battling obesity and eating disorders . '' -lsb- the -rsb- negative side to weight loss is that people treat people differently . being fat was a good filter -- i 'm automatically treated better by people because i 'm thinner . society is so hard on people who are overweight or obese , '' said pless . `` now , those people think i 'm funnier or smarter . '' pless runs about 40 miles a week while she trains for two marathons she plans to run this winter . the first is in november in las vegas , nevada , and the second is in miami , florida , in january . forty pounds ago , the first thing she wanted to do once she lost the weight was to have a tummy tuck to remove all of the loose skin . but now , she said she ca n't imagine taking the break from running that recovering from surgery would require . `` running has become a constant for me and does so much more for me than maintain my weight , which is now about 125 pounds , '' said pless . if her past is any indication of her future success , pless will certainly cross the finish line . i-report : have you lost weight ? share your story , tips and photos e-mail to a friend .

152	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the confirmation of michael mukasey as attorney general was all but assured friday when two key democratic senators said they will vote in favor of the nominee despite questions about his views on `` waterboarding '' and the president 's power to order electronic surveillance . sens. dianne feinstein of california and charles schumer of new york announced they would support the retired federal judge from new york just hours after the chairman of the judiciary committee announced his opposition to the nominee . feinstein and schumer are members of the senate judiciary committee , which is scheduled to vote on the mukasey nomination tuesday . if all the republican members of the committee also vote for mukasey , which is expected , his nomination will go before the full senate . a leading democrat , speaking on condition of anonymity , said wednesday mukasey is likely to be confirmed if his nomination passes the judiciary committee . schumer had praised the nomination of mukasey as a consensus candidate when the president announced mukasey as his choice to replace former attorney general alberto gonzales . gonzales gave up the post in september . `` this is an extremely difficult decision , '' schumer said . `` when an administration so political , so out of touch with the realities of governing and so contemptuous of the rule of law is in charge , we are never left with an ideal choice . judge mukasey is not my ideal choice . however , judge mukasey , whose integrity and independence is respected even by those who oppose him , is far better than anyone could expect from this administration . '' a number of democratic senators , however , have said they will oppose mukasey because of questions about his views on the interrogation technique called `` waterboarding '' and the president 's power to order electronic surveillance . waterboarding involves restraining a suspect and using water to produce the sensation of drowning . mukasey told senators this week that he finds waterboarding `` repugnant , '' but he could not answer whether the technique amounts to torture . while saying `` serious questions have been raised about judge mukasey 's views on torture and on separation of powers , '' feinstein said she would support the nominee because the justice department needed fresh leadership . `` first and foremost , michael mukasey is not alberto gonzales . rather , he has forged an independent life path as a practitioner of the law and a federal judge in the southern district of new york . `` i believe that judge mukasey is the best we will get and voting him down would only perpetuate acting and recess appointments , allowing the administration to avoid the transparency that confirmation hearings provide and diminish effective oversight by congress . '' just hours before feinstein and schumer announced their decisions , senate judiciary committee chairman sen. patrick leahy , d-vermont , announced he would vote against the mukasey nomination . watch sen. leahy explain why he ca n't support the mukasey nomination '' `` no american should need a classified briefing to determine whether waterboarding is torture , '' leahy said . `` waterboarding was used at least as long ago as the spanish inquisition . we prosecuted japanese war criminals for waterboarding after world war ii . `` i am eager to restore strong leadership and independence to the department of justice . i like michael mukasey . i wish that i could support his nomination . but i can not . america needs to be certain and confident of the bedrock principle -- deeply embedded in our laws and our values -- that no one , not even the president , is above the law . '' president bush demanded the senate confirm mukasey during a speech thursday at the heritage foundation , an influential conservative think tank . `` in a time of war , it 's vital for the president to have a full national security team in place , '' the president said . the president has equated asking mukasey about his opinion of waterboarding with asking him about the cia-run interrogation program , whose details are classified . bush said the program does not violate u.s. bans on torture , but added that mukasey `` does not want an uninformed opinion to be taken by our professional interrogators in the field as placing them in legal jeopardy . '' but leahy said `` judge mukasey was not asked to evaluate any secret ` facts and circumstances . ' '' `` he was asked whether waterboarding is illegal . our law makes torture illegal , and waterboarding is torture , and it is illegal . it is frankly not dependent on any , quote , ` relevant facts and circumstances of the technique 's past or proposed use , ' '' he said , quoting from mukasey 's response to senators on the question . sources with knowledge of the cia-run interrogation program have said agents are no longer using waterboarding . but those sources have said waterboarding was used in the interrogation of khalid shaikh mohammed , now facing trial before a military tribunal for planning al qaeda 's 2001 attacks on new york and washington . the practice was used by the spanish inquisition , cambodia 's khmer rouge and the world war ii japanese military , according to human rights watch . it is specifically banned in u.s. law governing the treatment of prisoners by the u.s. military . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's ted barrett contributed to this report .
153	atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- genarlow wilson , freed last week from a georgia prison , said he 's glad he rejected a plea deal from prosecutors , even if it would have sprung him from prison months earlier . genarlow wilson tells cnn on sunday that he will be more conservative and alert in the future . the 21-year-old , who served two years of a 10-year sentence for aggravated child molestation , said the prospect of being labeled a sex offender drove him to turn down the deal . he had to think about his 9-year-old sister and having a family of his own one day , he said sunday . `` it might 've been lesser time , but then again , i would have nowhere to go because i would have no home , '' wilson said during a cnn interview scheduled to air monday at 8 p.m. `` i would n't be able to stay with my mother because i have a little sister . you know , when you 're a sex offender you ca n't be around kids . basically , i ca n't even have kids myself , you know , so what is the point of life ? '' he asked . in 2005 , a jury found wilson guilty of aggravated child molestation for having oral sex with a 15-year-old girl at a 2003 new year 's eve party . wilson was 17 at the time of the party . watch wilson say why he rejected the plea deal '' the conviction carried a 10-year mandatory prison sentence and a sex offender designation . according to georgia attorney general thurbert baker , prosecutors in douglas county , georgia , offered wilson a plea deal that would have reduced his sentence , possibly to time served , and would have eventually removed the conviction and sex offender status from his record . defense attorney b.j. bernstein said in june that wilson rejected the deal because he did n't want to plead guilty to a felony with a 15-year sentence . the state legislature last year amended the law under which wilson was convicted , making such sexual encounters misdemeanors . however , the legislature did not make the law retroactive , so it had no effect on wilson 's sentence . now 21 , wilson was released friday after the state supreme court ruled 4-3 that the young man 's sentence `` constitutes cruel and unusual punishment . '' wilson said sunday he feels no `` negative energy '' toward district attorney david mcdade , who fought efforts to have wilson 's sentence reduced . instead , wilson said , he is focused on the future and hopes to soon immerse himself in his college studies . he wants to major in sociology , he said , `` because i feel like i 've been living my major . '' the new genarlow wilson will be more conservative , more alert and more appreciative of the blessings bestowed upon him , he said . `` when it seems like you have everything , you know , you feel like you have no worries until it 's all gone , and i know what it feels like to be without and i do n't want to ever feel like that again , '' said the former honor student , football star and homecoming king . `` i do n't ever want to see the inside of a prison or a prison , period . '' though he called his sentence `` absurd , '' wilson said he understands that prosecutors `` were doing their job and they felt they were carrying out the law .

154	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- behind the state banquet and smiles from queen elizabeth and british prime minister gordon brown , king abdullah of saudi arabia 's visit to london this week caused a wave of dissent . the uk political elite boycotted events . demonstrators lined the mall . the uk foreign secretary pulled out of a meeting with his saudi counterpart to be with his new adopted son . and just days before he arrived , the saudi king accused british officials of ignoring information that could have averted the terror attacks in london on july 2005 . whether the politics of the event were a success is open to debate . but this was just part of the story . the saudis were also in town to cement a strong trading and business relationship that has developed between the two kingdoms over the last 20 years . saudi arabia is the uk 's largest trading partner in the middle east . and behind the usa , the uk is the second largest foreign investor in the kingdom . uk trade & investment has designated saudi arabia one of its 17 `` high growth markets '' along with uae and qatar in the region . as the nation diversifies its economy away from oil , commercial opportunities for uk thrive in a variety of sectors . saudi arabia is currently planning six privately-developed economic cities . the $ 26.6 billion king abdullah economic city -- the largest of these -- will create one million jobs and home to two million residents . the aim , says the saudi arabian general investment authority , is to boost the economy by creating a pro-business environment , and attracting investors and fostering investment opportunities . the uk has , since the early 1990s , been one of the top five exporters to saudi arabia , behind usa , germany , china and japan . in 2007 , saudi arabian bank sabb predicts that uk exports to the kingdom will increase by more than 5.5 per cent to reach $ 2.8 billion . while the balance of trade continues to be favor of the british , saudi arabia 's exports to britain are also gaining ground and closing the trade gap . this year , exports to britain are expected to reach a record high of $ 2.1 billion , says sabb . and this is n't all about oil . in the 1980s , three quarters of saudi exports to the uk were from oil , but today the non-oil sector accounts for 59 percent of exports . products being shipped to the uk include machinery , transport equipment , plastics , non-metallic minerals and , despite the uk 's dominance in the sector , chemicals . according to sabb , there are also more than 150 saudi-british joint ventures underway with a value of around $ 15 billion . as john sfakianakis , chief economist from sabb says , state visits such as this are important for bolstering trade talks , past and future . `` the biggest deal that will mark their relationship in trade is the purchase of 72 eurofighter typhoon jets that was sealed last week , '' says sfakianakis . the contract between the kingdom and the uk ministry of defence via bae is worth over almost $ 10 billion for the aircraft alone and a further $ 19 billion for the deployment , maintenance and training . this comes less than a year after the uk government decided to call off a serious fraud office investigation into defense contracts with saudi arabia . this probe related to the sale of weapons by bae systems to saudi arabia in the 1980s . bae has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and making payments to saudi royals to win business . but as sfakianakis points out , any political sensitivity surrounding the visit is unlikely to harm future trading relationships between the nations . `` the relationship is far deeper than that , '' he says . `` saudi arabia 's economy is booming and the opportunities businessmen see here are immense . everything else takes a subsidiary part in that .

156	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- banksy is britain 's most wanted artist -- his art sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars , but he continues to use public spaces as his main canvas , while all the time keeping his identity a secret . banksy 's latest piece in east london where a passer-by claims to have taken a photo of the artist . the guerilla artist has been spray painting his stencils around britain and further afield for over ten years . last week ten of his original pieces were sold at bonham 's auction house in london for over $ 1 million , while on the other side of the city tower hamlets council authority pledged to remove his graffiti from its streets . from his beginnings as a graffiti artist in bristol , england , banksy has become the darling of the art world for his subversive and satirical public art . depicting things such as riot police with smiley acid-house faces and camera-wielding rats , his work is now sold now by major art galleries . lazarides gallery in london is one of the main dealers of his work and describes him as `` a media star ... but popular long before any of this high-profile activity -- simply because the people love his stuff . '' while he set out to lampoon the establishment , he has now been wholeheartedly embraced by it . fans include hollywood a-listers , including brad pitt and angelina jolie and christina aguilera who bought three of his prints in 2006 , including one of queen victoria sitting on a woman 's face . the recent sales of his work put him on a par with jean-michel basquiat as the best-selling street artist . he is feted by art dealers and artists , including damien hirst , but he regularly mocks the art world that is so enthralled by him with ingenious stunts such as hanging his own work in the tate gallery in london and the metropolitan museum of art in new york . it took the british museum eight days to discover the `` prehistoric '' rock painting of a man with a shopping trolley in the british museum banksy has hung on a wall . there is often a political message with this work , too . he left an inflatable doll dressed as a guantanamo prisoner in disneyland and painted a hole with blue sky on the palestinian side of the west bank wall . despite the huge popularity and exposure of his work , banksy 's identity remains a mystery . as he operates on the fringes of the law with his guerilla art it makes sense , but also adds to his mystique . some things are know : he 's originally from bristol , is around 30 years old and called robert or robin banks , but it 's been reported that even his parents are thought to believe that he makes his living as a painter and decorator . he continues to divide opinion as to whether his work is vandalism or public art . veteran british art critic brian sewell called banksy , `` a complete clown , and what he does has absolutely nothing to do with art . '' bristol city council has recognized the popularity and artistic merit of his work by protecting a number of pieces around the city . other local authorities do n't feel the same way . tower hamlets and hackney councils in london have pledged to remove his graffiti from their streets . his latest work painted on a wall in east london -- a man in overalls resting next to a giant flower drawn as a continuation from the double yellow lines on the road -- is thought to be the artist 's response . but this latest piece may also have revealed what the artist actually looks like . a passer-by took a photo of what is thought to be the artist at work . a spokesperson for banksy refused to confirm it was him , but did say it was definitely his work . e-mail to a friend .
157	rome , italy -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the garbage crisis in naples encompasses the worst italian clichés , and in particular those of the southern part of this lovely peninsula : mismanagement , political interference , mafia profiteering and the ability of those responsible to deflect the attention and the blame elsewhere . naples has had problems in finding sites for municipal dumps -- now workers have stopped collecting trash . there is a popular saying here that roughly goes like this : everybody is competent enough -lrb- to find a solution -rrb- but nobody is responsible -lrb- for actually carrying it out -rrb- . in many parts of the world waste disposal is a business -- and usually it is a good business . garbage can be transformed into various sources of energy and then sold for a profit . in naples , garbage is also good business , but in the sense that millions , if not billions , of euros have been wasted -- and nobody really knows how . the problem is as old and ugly as rotten trash . the region 's dumps reached full capacity more than a decade ago , and since then a state of emergency has been declared every year . eight different commissioners have been appointed , but they have all failed to solve the problem . state of emergency means government money : $ 1.8 billion -lrb- more than $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in emergency funds have been devolved to deal with the problem . it is still difficult to find out where or how that money has been spent . incinerators that were supposed to be built were never finished , either because the companies in charge of constructing them could not finish the job , or else because magistrates stopped the work , pending ongoing criminal investigations into alleged mafia involvement . one italian newspaper suggested that a good 20 % of the money went to pay for the salaries of those in charge of coming up with a solution to the problem . more worrying perhaps , is another suggestion : that the local mafia , known as the camorra , is taking advantage of the situation . as the crisis has worsened over the years , so the camorra 's profits , estimated now at around $ 1 billion -lrb- roughly $ 1.45 billion -rrb- , are alleged to have increased . how does the local mafia make money ? the naples prosecutor in charge of environmental crimes says city government officials use the state of emergency to quickly award contracts which otherwise would have to be checked by complicated anti-racketeering legislation . once they receive the money , companies linked to the underworld dispose of the waste either in the open or , ironically , at regular city dumps , even if they are overflowing . the mafia clans have now managed to burrow their way so deeply into the system that every attempt to fix the problem has proved futile . but why are citizens protesting now ? well , the government wants to re-open a previously shut dump to dispose of 3,700 tons of waste which is laying in the streets of naples and surrounding areas . the problem is that when the site was closed years ago , locals were promised that a golf course would be built there . as a result , many residents invested savings to construct apartments and residences in the vicinity -- in some cases just a few yards away from the site . they are now waking up to a mountain of trash instead of 18 holes . a rotten deal indeed . e-mail to a friend .
158	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- debra lafave , the former florida middle school teacher convicted of having sex with a student , violated her probation by hugging a young co-worker , a florida judge found thursday . debra lafave was arrested after talking with a teenager . she is not allowed to have contact with anyone under 18 . but the judge did not send lafave to jail , saying the violation was `` not willful and substantial . '' `` please do n't come back , '' he scolded . dressed in a tailored , black pantsuit , lafave said she had `` innocent '' physical contact with a female co-worker she knew as under age 18 . watch lafave in the courtroom '' at the time , she and the 17-year-old hostess worked at danny boy 's , a small restaurant in the tampa , florida , area . lafave , 27 , pleaded guilty in november 2005 to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and was sentenced to three years under house arrest and seven years of probation . lafave was required to register as a sex offender and ordered not to have any contact with minors . a tracking device she carries as part of her probation went off in court , prompting the prosecutor to observe , `` i think she 's accounted for . '' lafave acknowledged she was aware that hugs and other forms of physical contact -- as well as conversations about sex -- with minors violated terms of her probation . she referred to the sexually explicit conversations at work as just `` girl talk . '' lafave denied talking about her sex life with co-workers . `` i do n't speak that way about my personal life , '' she said . but she added that her co-workers spoke freely about sex in a `` small group setting . '' while other co-workers socialized outside work , lafave said , the 17-year-old was not included in those outings . asked why she hugged the young co-worker , lafave explained it was a small restaurant with a casual atmosphere where co-workers felt like family . the contact came , she said , `` out of my good nature , that 's the way it worked . '' the contacts that led to thursday 's probation violation hearing first surfaced during two polygraph tests administered as part of lafave 's court-ordered supervision . she received a verbal reprimand a year ago , according to testimony . when the behavior continued , her probation officer asked a judge to find her in violation . she was ordered to quit the restaurant job and now works as a receptionist in her mother 's beauty shop . in the past , lafave has said she suffers from bipolar disorder and is receiving treatment . e-mail to a friend .
159	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- 1 . the hamburger -- louis ' lunch , new haven , connecticut . this burger did not come from louis ' so ketchup is ok . there are competing claims for the coveted `` inventor of the hamburger '' title , but according to louis ' lunch -lrb- and the library of congress , for that matter -rrb- , this small new haven restaurant takes the prize . the story goes something like this : one day in 1900 , a rushed businessman asked owner louis lassen for something quick that he could eat on the run . lassen cooked up a beef patty , put it between some bread , and sent the man on his way . pretty modest beginnings for arguably the most popular sandwich of all-time , huh ? if you visit louis ' today , you 'll find that not much has changed . the lassen family still owns and operates the restaurant , the burgers are still cooked in ancient gas stoves , and , just like then , there is absolutely no ketchup allowed . 2 . the fried twinkie -- the chipshop , brooklyn , new york . sometimes what counts is n't being the inventor , it 's being the innovator . take the fried twinkie , for example . the twinkie -- in all its indestructible glory -- has been around for ages , but when chipshop owner christopher sell had the brilliant idea to freeze the snack , dip it in batter , and deep-fry it , the twinkie took gluttony to new heights . even the new york times raved about how `` something magical '' happens when you taste the deep-fried twinkie 's `` luscious vanilla flavor . '' sell , who was trained in classical french cuisine , did n't start with the twinkie , though . in his native england , he fried up everything from m&m 's to mars bars . 3 . root beer float -- myers avenue red soda co. , cripple creek , colorado . if you thought what happened up on cripple creek only happened in song , you 're sorely mistaken . in august of 1893 , a failed gold-miner-turned-soda-company-owner named frank j. wisner was drinking a bottle of his myers avenue red root beer while looking up at cow mountain . just then , a full moon illuminated the snowcap on the otherwise black mountain , and wisner had a brilliant idea -- float a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a glass of his root beer . the new drink was christened the `` black cow '' and became an instant classic . today , of course , most of us call it a root beer float . 4 . corn dogs -- cozy dog drive in , springfield , illinois . in 1946 , ed waldmire , jr. , revolutionized the stick-meat world when he debuted the cozy dog -- the first corn dog on a stick . at first , he wanted to call his creation the `` crusty cur , '' but his wife convinced him to change the name to `` cozy dog . '' she felt people would n't want to eat something described as `` crusty . '' good call , mrs. waldmire . shortly after the cozy dog 's inception , the cozy dog drive in opened alongside old route 66 and has been serving up corn dogs ever since . 5 . the pizzeria -- lombardi 's , new york city , new york . pizza has existed in one form or another for a long time , but america got her first true pizzeria when gennaro lombardi opened up a small grocery store in new york city 's little italy . an employee named anthony `` totonno '' pero started selling pizzas out of the back , and in no time , lombardi 's was concentrating on its burgeoning pizza business instead of plain old groceries . in 1905 , the establishment was licensed as a pizzeria , and it 's stayed that way ever since . well , almost . the original restaurant closed in 1984 but reopened down the street 10 years later . on its 100th anniversary in 2005 , lombardi 's decided to offer its pizza for the same price it 'd been sold for in 1905 -- 5 cents a pie . needless to say , the line wrapped around the block . 6 . fat darrell -- r.u. hungry , new brunswick , new jersey . you may not know what the fat darrell is , but when you hear what it contains , you 'll understand why it 's truly a work of inspired genius . since 1979 , rutgers university has played host to a collection of mobile food vans collectively known as the `` grease trucks . '' originally , they served a sandwich called the fat cat , which contained two cheeseburger patties , french fries , lettuce , tomato , and onions . then one night in 1997 , a hungry -lrb- and broke -rrb- student named darrell w. butler convinced one of the vendors to put chicken fingers , mozzarella sticks , french fries , and marinara sauce on a sandwich . strangely , the concoction sounded so appetizing that the next 10 people in line ordered it , and the fat darrell became a mainstay at the grease trucks . hey , not any old sandwich gets to be named maxim magazine 's top `` meat hog '' sandwich . 7 . philly cheesesteak -- pat 's king of steaks , philadelphia , pennsylvania . philadelphia is known for many things -lrb- ben franklin , the liberty bell , and rocky , for starters -rrb- , but fine dining is not really its forte . that 's ok , though , because philly is the home of pat 's king of steaks , and pat 's king of steaks is where the philly cheesesteak was born . one day back in 1932 , hot dog stand owners pasquale -lrb- pat -rrb- and harry olivieri decided to change things up and make a steak sandwich with onions . a cab driver who ate at pat 's daily insisted on trying the new sandwich , and with the first bite declared , `` hey , forget ` bout those hot dogs , you should sell these ! '' cab drivers know fast food about as well as anyone , so the brothers did just what the cabbie suggested . in no time , the modest stand turned into the pat 's that exists today . controversy remains , however , over who 's responsible for putting the cheese in cheesesteak . pat 's claims it was the first to do so -lrb- in 1951 -rrb- , but across-the-street rival joe vento of geno 's steaks -lrb- opened 1966 -rrb- insists he added the finishing touches . 8 . onion rings -- pig stand , dallas , texas . according to most sources , the onion ring was invented when a careless cook at a pig stand location in dallas accidentally dropped an onion slice in some batter , then pulled it out and tossed it in the fryer for lack of a better destination . now , you 'd think inventing the onion ring would be enough for one restaurant chain , but not pig stand . the company also lays claim to opening america 's first drive-in , inventing texas toast , and being one of the first restaurants to advertise using neon signs . not bad for a little outfit from texas . 9 . derby pie -- melrose inn , prospect , kentucky . a kentucky favorite , derby pie is a chocolate and pecan tart with a pastry-dough crust -- and that 's about all we know about it . why ? because the recipe is jealously guarded by the kern family . melrose inn manager george kern created derby pie in the mid-1950s with help from his parents , walter and leaudra , and the dessert was such a hit that the family was soon baking the treat full-time . in fact , mrs. kern , being the crafty monopolist she was , copyrighted the name , and to this day , you can only get real `` derby-pie ® '' through kern 's kitchen , inc. . not only that , but a man from new england once handed leaudra a blank check for the recipe so that his daughter could make the pie at home . she refused.i e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .
160	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush blasted the democratic-controlled congress on tuesday for having `` the worst record in 20 years .

'' bush criticized congress for not being able to send `` a single appropriations bill '' to him . `` they have n't seen a bill they could not solve without shoving a tax hike into it , '' he said . democrats quickly fired back . jim manley , senior aide to senate majority leader harry reid , said , `` taking advice from president bush about fiscal responsibility and getting things done for the american people is like taking hunting lessons from dick cheney . neither is a very good idea . '' rep. rahm emanuel , d-illinois , issued a statement saying , `` president bush 's rally this morning reminds us that congressional republicans remain ready and willing to rubber-stamp the bush agenda : no to children 's health care ; no to a new direction in iraq ; and no to investing in america 's future . the white house and congressional republicans want to continue the status quo . '' bush said the senate was `` wasting valuable time '' by taking up the children 's health insurance bill , which he had earlier vetoed . watch bush describe what he thinks congress is doing wrong '' house majority leader steny hoyer , d-maryland , issued a statement calling bush `` the biggest obstacle '' to extending health coverage to `` 10 million low-income , working-class american children . '' hoyer said gop house leaders need to `` stop posing for pictures , and sit down with democrats and republicans in congress who are working together to extend coverage to our children . '' the state children 's health insurance program measure passed in the house last week would expand the program by nearly $ 35 billion over five years , the same as the measure bush vetoed on october 3 . bush had proposed adding $ 5 billion to the program , and said the version he vetoed would have encouraged families to leave the private insurance market for the federally funded , state-run program . democratic leaders said the new version addresses republican objections by tightening restrictions on illegal immigrants receiving schip benefits ; capping the income levels of families that qualify for the program ; and preventing adults from receiving benefits . the program currently covers about 6 million children whose parents earn too much to qualify for medicaid , the federal health insurance program for the poor , but who ca n't afford private insurance . democrats want to extend the program to another 4 million , paying for it with a 61-cent-per-pack increase in the federal tax on cigarettes . bush said congress knows the current version of the children 's health bill `` does not have a chance , '' to get enough votes to override another veto . hoyer accused bush of breaking a promise he made in 2004 to extend coverage under the schip program . `` now , congress must do what the president said he would do , '' he said in his statement . the senate could vote on the bill as early as tuesday . bush also threatened to veto a `` three-bill pileup . '' `` there are now reports that congressional leaders may be considering combining the veterans and department of defense appropriations bills , and then add a bloated labor , health and education spending bill to both of them , '' he said . `` congress should pass each bill one at a time in a fiscally responsible manner , '' he said . bush also urged congress to send him a `` clean defense appropriations bill and a war supplemental bill . '' `` they ought to get me a bill that funds among other things bullets and body armor , '' he said . bush also criticized congress for trying to `` hold hostage '' funding for troops . `` it would be irresponsible to not give our troops the resources they need to get their job done because congress was unable to get its job done , '' he said . hoyer 's release said bush 's comments on appropriations bills and fiscal responsibility `` ring hollow . '' `` the fact is , this administration has pursued the most fiscally irresponsible policies in american history , turning record surpluses into record deficits and adding more than $ 3 trillion to the national debt , '' he said . `` democrats are the party of fiscal responsibility today because we believe our government must pay for the things it purchases and not force our children to pay our bills . the fight over 2008 appropriations bills is not a fight over spending . it is a fight over priorities .

'' at u.s. president george w. bush 's texas ranch , white house spokesman gordon johndroe said he did not believe the flights posed a threat to the united states . `` militaries around the world engage in a variety of activities , so this is not entirely surprising , '' he said . but the sorties are likely to add to western concern about russia 's growing assertiveness . that trend has prompted some u.s. policymakers to draw parallels with the cold war . putin caused a stir this year by saying russian missiles would once again be aimed at targets in europe if washington persisted with plans to build a missile defense shield in eastern europe . russian diplomats have clashed with the united states and european governments on issues such as kosovo , energy , and moscow 's treatment of its ex-soviet neighbors . western military leaders have said this year that russian flights near their airspace were becoming more frequent after a long quiet period . one western defense official called the flights `` a little bit of chest-pounding , trying to let people know russia is back in the game '' . putin said that when russia had cut its flights in 1992 , other military powers had not reciprocated . `` flights by other countries ' strategic aircraft continue and this creates certain problems for ensuring the security of the russian federation , '' putin said . that appeared to be a swipe at the u.s. and nato , whose strategic bombers have continued to fly long-range missions . as putin spoke to reporters and television cameras , four russian military helicopters appeared and hovered in the background while russian tanks trundled behind him , even though the exercises had ended long before . during the cold war , russian long-range bombers , which can carry strategic nuclear weapons , played elaborate games of cat-and-mouse with western air forces . earlier this month russian air force generals said bomber crews had flown near the pacific island of guam , where the u.s. military has a base , and `` exchanged smiles '' with u.s. pilots scrambled to track them . the pentagon said the russian aircraft had not come close enough to u.s. ships to prompt american aircraft to react . in july , two russian tu-95 `` bear '' bombers made unusually long sorties over the north sea , leading norway and britain to scramble fighter jets to follow them . russia 's air force said later it was a routine flight . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .
164	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- authorities in azerbaijan recently uncovered a radical islamic terror plot against the u.s. embassy in the capital , baku , prompting the facility to close its doors to the public monday , azerbaijan and u.s. officials told cnn . the bibi heybat mosque , just outside the capital baku . as a precaution , britain also shut its embassy in baku to the public on monday `` following security concerns nearby , '' britain 's foreign office said . the terror plot was unraveled after a weekend raid outside baku that netted several suspected members of the radical group , two u.s. officials who asked not to be identified and a spokesman for azerbaijan 's national security ministry told cnn . u.s. state department spokesman sean mccormack stressed that the details `` are still unfolding , '' and the threat `` may or may not be '' linked to the saturday raid . `` there were some specific and credible threat information concerning the embassy and plans by militants to in some way do harm to individuals in and around the u.s. embassy there , '' mccormack said , noting that no specific individuals were targeted . several days ago , an azerbaijani army officer who had connections to a radical islamic group seized four assault rifles , a machine gun and 20 hand grenades from his military unit and hid them in the outskirts of baku , the ministry spokesman and u.s. officials said . government security forces tracked down the group and arrested several members during a sweep on saturday in the village of mastaga , about 20 miles -lrb- 32 km -rrb- northeast of baku , the spokesman said . one suspected member of the militant group resisted arrest and was killed in the sweep , the spokesman said . several others are still at large , he added . he said the terror plot also targeted azerbaijani government buildings . the u.s. embassy in baku issued a warden message warning americans in azerbaijan to take precautions . `` while there is no information at this time that other american or western interests in azerbaijan are being targeted , the u.s. embassy encourages americans to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to bolster their own personal security , '' it said . azerbaijan is a former soviet republic that borders the caspian sea , and lies just north of iran . mccormack said u.s. authorities are working closely with their counterparts in baku and will determine when normal embassy operations will resume . he said he expects the embassy to limit its operations on tuesday , as well . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's igor malakhov in moscow , zain verjee in washington and roger clark in london contributed to this report .
165	-lrb- instyle -rrb- -- it all boils down to this . it does n't really matter all that much what hot , nubile french maverick has set the fashion world on fire . or which milanese visionary has a new fabric technique discovered during a life-changing trip to angkor wat that 's sure to bring back sixties minimalism with a twist . or that so-and-so has signed a deal to develop boutique spa hotels around the globe in former monasteries . because , in the end , he 's ralph lauren , and we 're not . ralph lauren has his eye on china and japan . for four decades no other designer has had a greater impact , not only on the way american men and women dress but also on the way they imagine , seek and indulge in the good life , than the former tie salesman from the bronx . `` those ties were handmade , by the way , '' recalls lauren . `` back then , ties , even designer ones , did n't sell for more than $ 5 apiece . mine were $ 12 to $ 15 . such luxury in something so simple was revolutionary . '' and ironic . because while no other designer logo exemplifies aspiration in the home of the free and the brave like the mallet-wielding guy on the pony , lauren originally named his company polo because `` it was the sport of kings . it was glamorous , sexy and international . '' see his designs '' in the beginning a few people questioned if it was named after marco polo -- but today the fact that virtually none of lauren 's millions of devoted customers has ever even seen a polo match is immaterial . lauren instinctively caught something that was in the air before any of his competitors had a chance to grab it -- the desire , not just to be a success but to look like one before you 'd even achieved your goal . what 's more , lauren made it look as easy as fred astaire dancing down a staircase . `` what matters the most to me are clothes that are consistent and accessible , '' says the designer . `` when i look at the people i 've admired over the years , the ultimate stars , like frank sinatra , cary grant and astaire , the ones who last the longest are the ones whose style has a consistency , whose naturalness is part of their excitement . and when you think of the blur of all the brands that are out there , the ones you believe in and the ones you remember , like chanel and armani , are the ones that stand for something . fashion is about establishing an image that consumers can adapt to their own individuality . and it 's an image that can change , that can evolve . it does n't reinvent itself every two years . '' however , with a media that is insatiable for the new , the now and the next , being steadfast does n't always make for good copy . `` the spotlight is always going to search for the newcomer , '' lauren admits . `` and that 's fine . but the key to longevity is to keep doing what you do better than anyone else . we work real hard at that . it 's about getting your message out to the consumer . it 's about getting their trust , but also getting them excited , again and again . my clothes -- the clothes we make for the runway -- are n't concepts . they go into stores . our stores . thankfully , we have lots of them , '' says lauren . `` what i rely on is people walking into my store saying , ' i want your clothes . ' '' well , if all of lauren 's customers shouted that together , he would go deaf faster than he could pull on one of his classic pullovers . lauren 's effortless luxury is all over the red carpet , on ski slopes and boats , at wimbledon and elsewhere . it furnishes living rooms and graces dinner tables . it 's on the bed , in the bed and under the bed -- and now sits on coffee tables , thanks to the tome ralph lauren -lrb- rizzoli -rrb- , celebrating his 40-years-and-growing career . but far from giving his customary over-the-head wave and riding off into his colorado-ranch sunset , the designer is going even more global . `` americans have a real inferiority about their own style . we 've brought sportswear to the world , and yet we have a long way to go . '' already in milan , london , paris and moscow , lauren has more stores planned for china , japan ... oh , everywhere . `` there are n't enough americans out there , '' he says . who better to start with than ralph ? just as long as he does n't let on that most of us still ca n't play a lick of polo . e-mail to a friend . get a free trial issue of instyle - click here ! copyright © 2007 time inc. . all rights reserved .
166	los angeles , california -- one of the bigger difficulties any first-time buyer faces is purchasing a car that does n't scream `` first-time '' to friends , relatives and co-workers , or indeed to the buyer each time they step into an ill-chosen purchase . a `` shark '' that races down roads . to break from the boring econobox , here are some of the more sculpted and stylish cars available for about $ 20,000 that will hold their looks for a long time and give a little bit of joy to a first-time owner . hyundai tiburon . if you did n't know already , tiburon means `` shark '' in spanish , and it 's not hard to see how hyundai 's sporty coupe can stalk the unwary first-time buyer and snare them quickly . like an instantly recognizable dorsal fin , the tiburon in its third incarnation is perhaps the purest low-slung sportster that wo n't bust a first-time buyer 's wallet , though it may chew a hole in the seat of their pants as they 're pushed back into those tight-hugging bucket seats . the startling hyundai-designed looks boast a touch of italian styling uncommon for its bracket . mazda mazdaspeed3 . a bona-fide pocket rocket , any first-time buyer can put a fair distance between themselves and the pack in the mazdaspeed3 , part of the asian carmaker 's strategy to wrestle performance compact coupe sales from european carmakers . this one is n't overbearingly dripped in trim or wings , but do n't let any youngster tell you it does n't have what it takes to make their peers jealous . the mazdaspeed3 will storm from standing to a mile a minute in under six seconds and is said to hit 155 mph . its secret is torque negation in the low gears -- and perhaps its 263 horses under the hood . another hidden gem is its seven-speaker bose stereo . pontiac g5 gt coupe . much like the fantastic chevy cobalt ss , its younger sister pontiac g5 gt boasts highly sprung motoring at a price that appeals to the first-time buyer 's wallet . the g5 gt has been tweaked just slightly from its sister ss -- like the difference between ashlee and jessica simpson -- boasting a less horizontal grille and more sculpted valance . both are reasonably stylish from the back and side and both leaving plenty room for aftermarket add-ons . a new grille entirely , like a phantom , may just be what you need to set it off against the crowd . the gt 's inline-four 2.4-liter 173-hp engine -- 25hp over the base -- drives the front wheels to hit 0-60 mph in 7.5 seconds . gas mileage is good and customer satisfaction ratings are off the hook . ford mustang v6 . a revamped chassis is the key to why ford 's mustang has become an outstanding product at a price that 's hard to beat . a tweak to the iconic lines for last year included a smaller back window and a longer , craggier front end . some might of course call us heretics for picking a v6 over the famous eight-cylinder included in the gt package but , to be honest , the v6 performs admirably , pushes out 210hp and emits a low-down growl that sounds wonderful . and it 's still a mustang . civic coupe . a civic hatch was my second car -lrb- after a very short-lived vw rabbit -rrb- . the coupe tested earlier this year brought back fond memories of the civic 's surprisingly roomy front cabin , its enjoyable handling and maneuverability , first-class economy and its sporty elongated hood and swooping back end . standard features include a 350-watt premium sound system , a touch-screen satellite-navigation system whose screen flips to reveal the cd player , and a slot for a computer memory card . it 's also got a funky dash that spectrally lights at night -- what fun . scion xb . on the heels of its 2004 release , toyota 's hipster scion brand has remodeled its boxy wonder this year , this time boasting more than a design nod to its parent company 's fj cruiser . wide rear pillars , wraparound headlights and bumper define the second-generation variant , which comes dripping with gadgetry inside , as well as leaving plenty of room for after-market customization . this one turns heads while allowing you to pack five adults in relative comfort . other notable features include a central console that fits in a dvd player alongside a backlit gps sat-nav system that lights up in any one of 10 colors . honda fit . a co-worker bought one of these after crashing her old and very badly beaten up saturn on a left turn into oncoming traffic . ouch . so it technically was n't her first car , but for many buyers , it will be . energetic , filled with flair and boasting a vertical fold the length of its bonnet , the fit looks the part as well as being colossally roomy inside for what you expect . you do n't get a third row of seats in there but , with the back row folded flat , it almost lends you to believe it can become a camper . other great touches include an mp3 input jack and reclining rear-seat headrests , while gas mileage is , as expected , very good indeed . e-mail to a friend .
167	tehran , iran -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- iran should be allowed to pursue its nuclear program for peaceful purposes , russian president vladimir putin said on tuesday during the first visit to the country by a kremlin leader since 1943 . putin , right , is greeted by iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad following his arrival in tehran . putin , who is in tehran to attend a summit of caspian sea nations , said that he and the other leaders agreed that `` peaceful nuclear activities must be allowed '' in the region . `` the iranians are cooperating with russian nuclear agencies and the main objectives are peaceful objectives , '' he said . russia is building iran 's first nuclear power plant and has resisted moves by the u.s. and its allies to impose stronger u.n. sanctions against tehran . on monday , u.s. defense secretary robert gates reiterated the bush administration 's stance that `` all options '' must be kept `` on the table '' in confronting the threats posed by iran -- a reference to the option of using military action against the long-time u.s. adversary . `` we should have no illusions about the nature of this regime or its leaders -- about their designs for their nuclear program , their willingness to live up to their rhetoric , their intentions for iraq , or their ambitions in the gulf region , '' gates said in a speech to the jewish institute for national security affairs . the leaders of iran , russia , kazakhstan , turkmenistan and azerbaijan also met tuesday to reach agreement on issues relating to the sharing and regulating of the caspian sea -- the world 's largest inland body of water . speaking afterwards , putin said that no caspian nation should offer its territory to third parties intent on military action against other countries in the region -- a reference to rumors that the u.s. planned to use azerbaijan as a base for a possible attack against iran , the associated press reported . `` we are saying that no caspian nation should offer its territory to third powers for use of force or military aggression against any caspian state , '' putin said . `` the caspian sea is an inland sea and it only belongs to the caspian states , therefore only they are entitled to have their ships and military forces here , '' added iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad . putin , defying reports of an assassination plot against him , was greeted by iranian foreign minister manouchehr mottaki as he stepped off his plane at tehran 's mehrabad airport . during a news conference monday after talks with german chancellor angela merkel in wiesbaden , germany , putin said rumors of an attempt on his life would not stop his plans . `` of course i will travel to iran , '' putin said . `` if i reacted to these kinds of rumors every time , i could never leave the house . '' iranian officials denied there was an assassination plot against putin , with a foreign ministry spokesman describing rumors of a possible terrorist action during the putin visit baseless . `` spreading this kind of totally false news lacks any value and can not damage the trend of the prepared programs , '' spokesman mohammadali hosseini told the iranian fars news agency . hosseini blamed the rumor on western media , particularly the u.s. media , saying the report was `` made up by the enemies of relations between iran and russia to create a psychological war . '' putin 's visit is the first by a leader in the kremlin to iran since joseph stalin 's world war ii conference meeting with u.s. president franklin d. roosevelt and british prime minister winston churchill . `` putin 's trip to tehran is a show of russia 's independence in global affairs . putin , who approaches the end of his term , wants to demonstrate that he would n't cave in to the u.s. pressure , '' said alexander pikayev , an expert on iran with russia 's institute for world economy and international relations , in a report carried by ap . putin 's schedule also includes meetings with ahmadinejad and iran 's supreme leader , ali khamenei , ap said . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 cnn . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed . associated press contributed to this report .
168	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- erik prince , the chairman and ceo of blackwater usa , appeared tuesday before the house committee on oversight and government reform . erik prince , ceo and chairman of blackwater usa , is sworn in tuesday at a congressional hearing . the committee convened amid an fbi investigation into a september 16 shootout involving blackwater personnel that resulted in the deaths of iraqi civilians . following is a transcript of prince 's opening statement : . chairman -lsb- henry -rsb- waxman , -lsb- d-california -rsb- , congressman -lsb- thomas -rsb- davis , -lsb- r-virginia -rsb- , members of the committee , my name is eric prince , and i am the chairman and ceo of the prince group and blackwater usa . blackwater 's a team of dedicated professionals who provide training to america 's military and law enforcement communities and risk their lives to protect americans in harm 's way overseas . under the direction and oversight of the united states government , blackwater provides an opportunity for military and law enforcement veterans with a record of honorable service to continue their support to the united states . words alone can not express the respect i have for these brave men and women who defend -- who volunteer to defend u.s. personnel facilities and diplomatic missions . i am proud to be there to represent them today . after almost five years in active service as a u.s. navy seal , i founded blackwater in 1997 . i wanted to offer the military and law enforcement communities assistance by providing expert instruction and world-class training venues . ten years later , blackwater trains approximately 500 members of the united states military and law enforcement agencies every day . after 9/11 , when the u.s. began its stabilization efforts in afghanistan and then iraq , the united states government called upon blackwater to fill a need for protective services in hostile areas . blackwater responded immediately . we are extremely proud of answering that call in supporting our country . blackwater personnel supporting our overseas missions are all military and law enforcement veterans , many of whom have recent military deployments . no individual ever protected by blackwater has ever been killed or seriously injured . there is no better evidence of the skill and dedication of these men . at the same time , 30 brave men have made the ultimate sacrifice while working for blackwater and its affiliates . numerous others have been wounded and permanently maimed . the entire blackwater family mourns the loss of these brave lives . our thoughts and our prayers are with their families . the areas of iraq in which we operate are particularly dangerous and challenging . blackwater personnel are subject to regular attacks by terrorists and other nefarious forces within iraq . we 're the targets of the same ruthless enemies that have killed more than 3,800 american military personnel and thousands of innocent iraqis . any incident where americans are attacked serves as a reminder of the hostile environment in which our professionals work to keep american officials and dignitaries safe , including visiting members of congress . in doing so , more american service members are available to fight the enemy . blackwater shares the committee 's interest in ensuring the accountability and oversight of contract personnel supporting u.s. operations . the company 's personnel are already accountable under and subject to numerous statutes , treaties and regulations of the united states . blackwater looks forward to working with congress and the executive branch to ensure that any necessary improvements to these laws and policies are implemented . the worldwide personnel protection services contract , which has been provided to this committee , was competitively awarded and details almost every aspect of operation and contract performance , including the hiring , vetting guidelines , background checks , screening , training standards , rules of force and conduct standards . in iraq , blackwater reports to the embassy 's regional security officer , or rso . all blackwater movements and operations are directed by the rso . in conjunction with internal company procedures and controls , the rso ensures that blackwater complies with all relevant contractual terms and conditions , as well as any applicable laws and regulations . we have approximately 1,000 professionals serving today in iraq as part of our nation 's total force . blackwater does not engage in offensive or military missions but performs only defensive security functions . my understanding of the september 16 incident is that the department of state and the fbi are conducting a full investigation , but those results are not yet available . we at blackwater welcome the fbi review announced yesterday , and we will cooperate fully and look forward to receiving their conclusions . i just want to put some other things in perspective . a recent report from the department of state stated that in 2007 blackwater conducted 1,873 security details for diplomatic visits to the red zone , areas outside the green zone in iraq , and there have been only 56 incidences in which weapons were discharged , or less than 3 percent of all movements . in 2006 , blackwater conducted over 6,500 diplomatic movements in the red zone . weapons were discharged in less than 1 percent of those missions . to the extent there is any loss of innocent life , ever , let me be clear that i consider that tragic . every life , whether american or iraqi , is precious . i stress to the committee and to the american public , however , that i believe we acted appropriately at all times . i am prepared to answer your questions . e-mail to a friend .

170	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- with the election of the next president a year away , sen. hillary clinton remains the person to beat , a cnn/opinion research corporation poll released monday suggests . as the countdown begins to november 4 , 2008 , the new york democrat continues to dominate the race for the democratic presidential nomination , and comes out ahead when voters are asked whether they prefer her or the gop front-runner , former new york mayor rudy giuliani . but clinton 's path to the white house is in no way certain . clinton was criticized for her performance during a debate last week , and her rivals for the democratic nomination have stepped up attacks that she has equivocated on her position on iraq , iran and other major issues . the republican presidential candidates have also stepped up their attacks on the democratic front-runner , with each suggesting that he has the best chance of stopping clinton . the attacks may be working . the cnn/opinion research polls suggests that clinton 's support has slipped from its height one month ago . watch cnn 's bill schneider on the latest poll numbers '' `` clinton 's strength is about where it was throughout the summer , indicating that she has lost the support she gained last month but that obama has not yet cut into her core constituency , '' cnn political director keating holland said . clinton is the top choice of 44 percent of the likely democratic voters interviewed for the poll . her closest rival , sen. barack obama of illinois , was the top choice of 25 percent , and former sen. john edwards of north carolina has 14 percent . all other democratic candidates were in single digits . new mexico gov. bill richardson was backed by 4 percent , sen. joe biden of delaware by 3 percent , sen. christopher dodd by 2 percent , ohio rep. dennis kucinich by 2 percent and former alaska sen. mike gravel was at 1 percent . the poll involved 467 interviews conducted on november 2-4 with democrats or independents who lean democratic . the poll 's margin of error was plus or minus 4.5 percentage points . view the poll results '' in an october cnn/opinion research poll , clinton was supported by 51 percent of democratic voters and had a 30 point lead over obama . during last week 's democratic debate , clinton received heavy criticism from her fellow democratic presidential rivals , who are desperate to shake up the presidential race just months before the first voting occurs in the iowa caucus in early january . edwards was particularly aggressive during the debate , criticizing clinton for her stance on iraq , iran and social security . `` the american people ... deserve a president of the united states that they know will tell them the truth and wo n't say one thing one time and something different at a different time , '' edwards said . edwards has also accused clinton of being a `` corporate democrat '' too willing to defend a `` corrupt '' washington establishement . `` we desperately need in the next president someone that recognizes we have a system in washington that 's become broken , corruption has crept into it , and we have to tell the truth about that , '' edwards said monday . `` if you defend that system , i do n't believe you can bring about the change that america needs . '' in the republican presidential race , giuliani continues to be the leading candidate , with the backing of 28 percent of the republican primary voters polled . former sen. fred thompson of tennessee was backed by 19 percent . sen. john mccain of arizona was the top pick of 16 percent , and former massachusetts gov. mitt romney had 11 percent . of the remaining republican candidates , former arkansas gov. mike huckabee received 10 percent , texas rep. ron paul 5 percent , california rep. duncan hunter 4 percent and colorado rep. tom tancredo 3 percent . the poll involved telephone interviews with 397 republicans or independents who lean republican . the poll 's margin of error was 5 percentage points . in a head-to-head matchup of the two front-runners , clinton leads giuliani 51 percent to 45 percent . that lead has increased since october , when clinton led giuliani 49 percent to 47 percent . `` the overall political environment seems to favor the democrats , partly because democratic voters are more enthusiastic about the coming election and partly because the public is in a sour mood , which is usually not a good sign for the incumbent party , '' holland said . only 42 percent of americans think things are going well , while 58 percent think things are going badly , the poll found . `` the public is not just pessimistic about the country -- americans are angry , '' holland said . `` more than eight in 10 say they are angry about the way things are going in the country . '' clinton 's lead over giuliani would be greater if a third-party candidate entered the race who believes abortion should be illegal in all circumstances , the poll found . in a three-way race , clinton would get the support of 48 percent of voters , giuliani 32 percent and the third-party candidate 18 percent . the poll 's margin of error was plus-or-minus 3 percent . `` my analysis of it is that -lsb- a third-party candidate -rsb- is more of an attempt to keep the nomination from me , '' giuliani said . `` you know it is a tactic , and a legitimate one . people have to think about that and consider it . '' the lack of enthusiasm for giuliani , particularly by social conservatives , could spell trouble for the gop next year if he becomes the nominee , holland said . `` only 27 percent of republicans say they would feel enthusiastic if giuliani won the gop nod , and the remaining gop candidates fare even worse , '' he said . e-mail to a friend .

172	paris , france -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- three french journalists charged in an alleged plot to kidnap african children for adoption in europe arrived in paris on sunday , hours after french president nicolas sarkozy held emergency talks in chad . but 14 other people remained in custody in the african nation , some facing serious charges that could send them to jail for up to 20 years . the journalists were among seven europeans a chadian judge released sunday , including a spanish flight crew , whom sarkozy dropped off in a brief stop in madrid on his way back from chad . all were arrested last week after workers from zoe 's ark -- a french-based charity group -- were accused of trying to fly 103 children out of chad in a kidnapping and adoption operation . watch a report on how the events unfolded '' some of the children may never return to their families because it is too difficult to determine their backgrounds , red cross spokeswoman inah kaloga told cnn on friday . those who remain under arrest in chad are six members of the french charity , four chadians and four remaining members of the flight crew . some face kidnapping and fraud charges . zoe 's ark leader eric breteau testified saturday to a court in the chadian capital that the three journalists and the flight crew of seven spaniards and a belgian were not involved in the alleged plot , court witnesses told cnn . at least some of the flight crew are scheduled to testify before a judge on monday . the three journalists initially had been charged with complicity in the alleged kidnapping attempt . it 's not clear if the charges against them have been dropped . watch the freed europeans leave chad '' in a joint news conference with spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero on sunday at madrid 's torrejon air force base , sarkozy expressed satisfaction that some of those detained had been released . at the same time , however , he told reporters , `` we should respect the sovereignty of chad . '' zapatero thanked sarkozy for dropping the four spanish flight crew members off in their home country , and thanked chadian president idriss deby for allowing them to return . after his emergency talks in chad , sarkozy stressed the scandal would not affect the strong relations between the two countries or affect the planned deployment of a european force to protect refugees from sudan 's darfur region who have fled to chad and the neighboring central african republic . sarkozy also said he hoped the six remaining french nationals -- all from zoe 's ark -- would face trial in france . the charity says that the children were orphans from the darfur region -- where the united nations estimates 200,000 people have been killed in four years of conflict -- and that the group was taking them to host families in france . but after preliminary interviews with the children , aid agencies said thursday it appeared most of them probably are not orphans and not from sudan , but instead come from villages on the chadian side of the border with sudan . the children are staying in an abeche orphanage while aid agencies and government officials try to find out where they came from -- a challenge hindered by the number of children , their youth , and the volatile situation in the region . a father of three of the children allegedly kidnapped told a french newspaper he put his children into the charity 's care after he was told they would be educated at a school under construction in a nearby town . the chadian man , who gave his name as arbab , told le parisien on sunday that workers from zoe 's ark had visited his village three times . `` they never said they would take away our children , '' he told the newspaper . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's nic robertson and al goodman contributed to this report .

'' glass described it as `` mind-boggling '' that simpson never had to put up any collateral for his first bond and that the bail bondsman never asked for anything . prosecutors also produced wednesday a recording of a profanity-laced voice mail message left on pereira 's answering machine in november from simpson , which he told pereira to deliver to co-defendant clarence stewart . the prosecutor said the message contained `` an undercurrent of a threat , '' and he wanted the bail to be raised to at least $ 1 million . galanter did not contest the authenticity of the recording . as part of his bail granted september 19 , simpson was to have no contact whatsoever with victims , witnesses or co-defendants in the case . glass said the same goes this time . watch how simpson wound up in jail '' `` when i tell you , mr. simpson , there are conditions and there are rules , let me make sure you understand if you violate those rules ... you 'll be back , locked up in the clark county detention center ; do you understand me ?

'' `` he will abide scrupulously by whatever this court decides , '' the attorney said . simpson faces trial april 7 on 12 criminal counts , including conspiracy , kidnapping , robbery , burglary , coercion and assault with a deadly weapon . the charges stem from a september 13 incident at a las vegas hotel in which he allegedly stole sports memorabilia he said belonged to him from dealers alfred beardsley and bruce fromong . according to earlier testimony , beardsley and fromong were offering more than 600 simpson-related items for sale , including ties simpson wore during his criminal trial for the 1994 murders of his ex-wife , nicole brown simpson , and her friend ron goldman . simpson was acquitted in that trial . e-mail to a friend .
175	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the air force is returning f-15e strike eagle jets to service over iraq and afghanistan after grounding other f-15s , the air force said wednesday . the air force grounded models of its f-15 fleet after the crash of an older model f-15c this month . the f-15s were grounded after a crash earlier this month in missouri of an older model that disintegrated in flight . each f-15e must pass an inspection of critical parts on the airframe before returning to flying missions , air force officials said . all u.s. air force 224 e-model aircraft will undergo a one-time inspection of hydraulic system lines , the air force statement said . the longerons -- molded , metal strips of the aircraft fuselage that run from front to rear -- will also be inspected , according to the air force . the straps and skin panels in and around the environmental control system bay will also be examined , officials said . the air force would not say whether the parts being inspected were part of the problem on the aircraft that crashed . the investigation into why that plane fell apart in flight is still ongoing and air force officials will not say what happened until the investigation is complete , an air force spokesperson said . air force officials said the rest of the almost 500 f-15s -- older airframes than the f-15es -- will remain grounded until the investigation offers a solution to what happened . the e-model aircraft , the youngest and most sophisticated in the f-15 inventory , is heavily used by central command for ground support in the u.s.-led wars in iraq and afghanistan . it is also used for the homeland security mission over the united states known as operation noble eagle . on november 3 , the air force grounded all of its f-15s in response to a november 1 crash of a missouri air national guard f-15c in boss , missouri . the grounding forced central command to use other air force , navy and french fighters to fill the gaps , though strike eagles did fly to support troops in battle in afghanistan as an emergency measure while they were still under grounding orders , according to central command reports . the plane that crashed , built in 1980 , was one of the older f-15s in the fleet . the f-15e strike eagle is an air-to-ground and air-to-air fighter , making it more versatile than other f-15 models , which are used for only air-to-air missions . the strike eagle is used in afghanistan and iraq in its air-to-ground role , using its advanced sensors to drop bombs on targets . e-mail to a friend .

177	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sen. barack obama on thursday criticized a recent vote by democratic presidential rival sen. hillary clinton as helping to give president bush a `` blank check '' to take military action against iran . sen. barack obama says sen. hillary clinton has shown `` flawed '' judgment . `` we know in the past that the president has used some of the flimsiest excuses to try to move his agenda regardless of what congress says , '' obama said in an interview with cnn 's wolf blitzer . last month , clinton voted to support a resolution declaring iran 's islamic revolutionary guard corps , an elite part of the iranian military , a foreign terrorist group . -lrb- the nonbinding amendment to the defense authorization act passed by a 76-22 vote . -rrb- . obama said he would have voted against the measure but did n't because he was campaigning in new hampshire at the time . he said it was impossible to know when votes will be scheduled in the senate . `` this is a problem '' related to running for president , he said . obama said clinton also had shown `` flawed '' judgment during the vote to authorize the iraq war five years ago . `` we know that there was embodied in this legislation , or this resolution sent to the senate , language that would say our iraqi troop structures should in part be determined by our desire to deal with iran , '' obama said . `` now if you know that in the past the president has taken a blank check and cashed it , we do n't want to repeat that mistake . '' clinton on thursday defended her vote on the resolution during an interview on new hampshire public radio , saying `` what i voted on was a nonbinding resolution . it 's not an amendment . it 's not a law . '' while clinton was campaigning sunday in new hampton , iowa , an audience member at a town hall-style meeting pressed her on why she voted for the iran measure and asked why she had n't learned from past `` mistakes . '' calling `` the premise of the question '' wrong , the senator from new york argued the resolution calls for the terrorist label so that sanctions can be imposed . the sanctions , clinton said , will in turn `` send a clear message to the leadership '' and lead to stronger diplomatic efforts . earlier this month , clinton also co-sponsored legislation with sen. jim webb , d-virginia , that would prohibit military operations against iran without congressional approval . obama 's comments came on the fifth anniversary of the 77-23 senate vote that authorized the president to use force against iraq . obama , then an illinois state senator , spoke out against the resolution authorizing force at the time . clinton 's 2002 vote shows a clear difference in judgment between the two of them , obama said . watch as obama questions clinton 's judgment '' `` i do n't think it disqualified her , but i think it speaks to her judgment and it speaks to my judgment , '' obama said . `` it speaks to how we will make decisions going forward . `` i think her judgment was flawed on this issue . '' obama said he also will step up efforts to clarify his differences with clinton , whom many political observers view as the front-runner for the democratic nomination . `` there 's no doubt we are moving into a different phase of the campaign , '' obama said . `` the first part of a campaign is to offer some biography and give people a sense of where i 've been and what i am about . `` in this next phase , we want to make sure that voters understand that on big issues , like the decision to go into the war in iraq , i had real differences with the other candidates , and that reflects on my judgment . '' another leading democratic candidate , john edwards , also voted in 2002 to authorize force in iraq while he was then a senator from north carolina . he later called his vote a mistake . in a veiled swipe at clinton , obama also suggested he could better unite the country and offer `` something new , as opposed to looking backward and simply duplicating some of the politics that we 've become so accustomed to , that frankly the american people are sick of . '' obama would not say whether he would consider clinton as his running mate should he become the democratic party 's nominee . `` i think sen. clinton is a very capable person , '' he said . `` right now , my goal is to make sure i am the nominee , and she is still the senator from new york .

181	las vegas , nevada -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a young girl shown on video being sexually assaulted was raped while in the care of a baby sitter her mother hired , the mother 's attorney said tuesday . chester arthur stiles , 37 , of nevada is being sought as a suspect in the videotaped rape of a young girl . the mother did not know her daughter had ever been victimized and was apparently oblivious to efforts to find her until last friday , jerry t. donohue said . `` a family friend called her and said , ` my god , you need to turn on the tv . i believe that is your daughter , ' '' he said . donohue said the mother recognized the suspect , chester arthur stiles , 37 , a former animal trainer . the abuse most likely occurred while the mother - a single woman working six days a week - was at work , donohue said . the attorney said he knows who the baby sitter is , but would not release that information because of the ongoing investigation . earlier , officials had said the girl , who is now 7 , was 3-years-old at the time the video was made . but donohue said tuesday , `` to my understanding , the abuse occurred before she was 3 years old . '' the mother of the girl asked that the news media leave the family alone . `` i want to ask you , the press , to respect my family 's privacy and to not attempt to contact my daughter or myself , '' the mother said in a written statement read by her attorney . watch donohue read the mother 's statement '' the mother also said she is cooperating with investigators and that her daughter `` is safe and healthy . '' the girl 's videotaped rape set off a nationwide search last week . she was found friday with family in las vegas , nevada , after thousands of tips poured in . professionals have since evaluated her and she appears to be `` healthy and fine and happy , '' the lawyer said . the lawyer said neither he nor the mother has watched the videotape . asked whether the mother is thankful to the news media for having published the girl 's picture so that authorities were able to identify her , donohue said , `` not really ... there 's some things maybe you do n't want to know . '' still , he said , he hopes the man in the tape is brought to justice . `` speaking as a father myself , i wish the guy would dig a hole in the desert and put a gun in his mouth , '' he said , referring to such an outcome as `` wild-west justice . '' meanwhile , the intense manhunt for stiles continued tuesday . on monday , stiles ' former girlfriend , tina allen , told cnn she thinks she is the reason stiles came in contact with the girl and is `` mortified '' by the allegations against him . allen said she and stiles were in an on-again , off-again relationship for 10 years until recently , when she called it off . `` he said he 'd been in the navy and , you know , i was looking for a strong guy to represent to my sons what i thought they needed to be , '' allen said . allen said she took stiles to a crowded apartment where her son and daughter lived . also living in the apartment were a family friend and her daughter , who allegedly was victimized by stiles . `` i 'm disgusted . i 'm ashamed , embarrassed , mortified , '' allen said of the alleged rape . `` i regret every , every step i ever took , i feel bad for the baby . '' the fbi is also seeking stiles , a resident of pahrump , nevada , in a separate matter involving state charges of sexual assault and lewdness with a minor under the age of 14 . pahrump is about 60 miles west of las vegas . a man who said he found the tape in the desert and held it for at least five months before handing it over to authorities turned himself in sunday to nye county officials . darren tuck , a nevada resident who allegedly showed the tape to others before giving it to police , faces charges of exhibiting pornography and possession of child pornography . e-mail to a friend .

'' `` it was an attempted robbery , aggravated robbery , '' he said . bradford `` was targeted because of some information that was out there and the fact that they believed he had some cash , or he had something that they wanted .

183	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- former detainees of immigration and customs enforcement accuse the agency in a lawsuit of forcibly injecting them with psychotropic drugs while trying to shuttle them out of the country during their deportation . raymond soeoth , pictured here with his wife , says he was injected with drugs by ice agents against his will . one of the drugs in question is the potent anti-psychotic drug haldol , which is often used to treat schizophrenia or other mental illnesses . doctors say they are required to see patients in person before such drugs are administered . two immigrants , raymond soeoth of indonesia and amadou diouf of senegal in west africa , told cnn they were injected with the drugs against their will . both are plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit brought by the american civil liberties union against the government . they are seeking an end to the alleged practice and unspecified damages . watch why the former detainees claim abuse '' dr. paul appelbaum , a professor of psychiatry , law and ethics at columbia university , reviewed both men 's medical records for this report and was stunned by what he discovered . `` i 'm really shocked to find out that the government has been using physicians and using potent medications in this way , '' said appelbaum , who also serves as a member of the american academy of psychiatry and the law . `` that is the sort of thing that would be subject to a malpractice claim in the civilian world . '' the allegations of ice forcibly drugging deportees were raised last month by sen. joe lieberman , i-connecticut , during the re-nomination hearing of ice chief julie myers . `` the information the committee has received from ice regarding the forced drugging of immigration detainees is extremely troubling , particularly since it appears ice may have violated its own detention standards , '' lieberman spokeswoman leslie phillips told cnn in an e-mail . `` senator lieberman intends to follow up with ice to ensure that detainees are not drugged unless there is a medical reason to do so . '' aclu attorney ahilan arulanantham , who is representing soeoth and diouf , said , `` it would be torture to give a powerful anti-psychotic drug to somebody who is n't even mentally ill . ... but here , it 's happening on u.s. soil to an immigrant the government is trying to deport . '' responding to lieberman 's written questions , myers said 1,073 immigration detainees had `` medical escorts '' for deportation since 2003 . from october last year to the end of april this year , she said 56 received psychotropic medications during the removal process . of those , 33 detainees received medication `` because of combative behavior with the imminent risk of danger to others and/or self , '' she said . `` first , i am aware of , and deeply concerned about reports that past practices may not have conformed to ice detention standards , '' myers said . she added no detainee should be `` involuntarily medicated without court order , '' except in emergency situations . but both soeoth and diouf say they had not exhibited any combative behavior . soeoth , a christian minister from indonesia , spent 27 months in detention awaiting deportation after his bid for political asylum was rejected . hours before he was to be sent back home on december 7 , 2004 , he says guards injected him with a mystery drug that made him groggy for two days . see the document that shows soeoth was injected . `` they pushed me on the bench , they opened my pants , and they just give me injection , '' he said through broken english . he says he was taken to los angeles international airport while in this drug-induced stupor , but two hours before takeoff , airline security refused to transport him , so ice agents returned him to his cell at terminal island near los angeles . terminal island , once a federal prison , is a crowded facility along the ocean where hundreds of illegal immigrants await deportation . soeoth 's medical records indicate he was injected with cogentin and haldol , even though those same records show he has no history of mental illness . in the records , the government says he was injected with the drug after he said he would kill himself if deported -- a remark soeoth denies ever making . ice said in a written statement it could n't respond to specific allegations due to pending litigation . `` department of homeland security law enforcement personnel may not and do not prescribe or administer medication to detainees , '' the ice statement said . `` only trained and qualified medical professionals , including officers of the u.s. public health service , may prescribe or administer medication . '' but , diouf says , he was injected on the plane right before he was to be deported . he said he even had a federal stay of his deportation -- and the paperwork to prove it -- but his u.s. government escorts would n't let him show it to the pilot of the plane preparing to fly him out of the country . see diouf 's stay of deportation document . that 's when , he says , `` i was wrestled to the ground and injected through my clothes . '' a government report says he was medicated because he did not follow orders . in both cases , diouf and soeoth remain in the united states pending a decision in the case . if they lose , they may land back in the hands of ice , once again facing deportation . soeoth says he 's traumatized by what happened . `` i know this country -lsb- is -rsb- very generous to immigrants , '' he says . `` what they did to me was very , very bad .

184	tampa , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- some christian congregations , particularly in lower income , urban areas , are turning to an unlikely source for help -- the church of scientology . rev , charles kennedy uses scientology founder l. ron hubbard 's book during a friday night sermon . scientologists do not worship god , much less jesus christ . the church has seen plenty of controversy and critics consider it a cult . so why are observant christians embracing some of its teachings ? two pastors who spoke recently with cnn explained that when it comes to religion , they still preach the core beliefs of christianity . but when it comes to practicing what they preach in a modern world , borrowing from scientology helps . the rev. charles kennedy , of the glorious church of god in christ , a pentecostal church in tampa , florida , and the rev. james mclaughlin , of the wayman chapel african methodist episcopal church in houston , texas , are among the theological hybrids . watch rev. kennedy preach '' they say they are not scared off by programs with ties to a church that critics say has aggressive recruiting , secretive ways and rigid theology . as men of god rooted in christian values , they do not see scientology as a threat to their faith , but rather as a tool to augment it . scientology was founded in the 1950s by l. ron hubbard , a science fiction writer . followers are taught that they are immortal spiritual beings called thetans . although the church says there is a supreme being , its practices do not include worshipping god . `` i 'm looking for solutions , and the people that i help , they do n't ask me who l. ron hubbard is , '' said mclaughlin , who works with addicts . `` you know what they say ? ` thank god . ' '' critic rick ross , a court-certified scientology expert , sees something more sinister at work . he warned that mainstream acceptance makes it easier for the scientologists to achieve their ultimate goal -- new recruits . `` their hope is that through these programs , people will become more interested in l. ron hubbard , what else mr. hubbard had to offer , and this will lead them eventually to scientology , '' ross said . the church has long been in the headlines for practices critics say are little more than cult-like mind control . it is also known for its stable of devout celebrity followers . and according to published reports , scientology has been recently diversifying its outreach to include other religions and ethnic groups . kennedy , mclaughlin and a handful of other christian church leaders -- no one can say how many -- are finding answers to their communities ' needs in scientology 's social programs . for kennedy , it began two years ago when he attended a meeting at the church of scientology 's spiritual headquarters in clearwater , florida . he was introduced to a book called `` the way to happiness '' -- hubbard 's 64-page , self-described `` common sense guide to better living . '' in the book , which lays out ways to maintain a temperate lifestyle , kennedy found a message he believed could help lift his predominantly lower income african-american congregation . he said the book 's 21 principles help them with their struggle in an urban environment where there is too much crime and addiction and too little opportunity . kennedy knew that before he could introduce any scientology-related text to his congregation , he would have to prove that it did not contradict his christian beliefs . and so , he found scripture to match each of the 21 principles . now kennedy uses `` the way to happiness '' as a how-to supplement to his sermons . he believes it is easier to understand and clearer to follow than ancient scriptures taken from the bible . when asked whether scientology 's values contradict the religion of jesus christ , kennedy replies , `` sometimes yes . sometimes no . '' but he says his congregation can relate to `` the way to happiness . '' kennedy admits other pastors have criticized him , but the disapproval is not enough to discourage him . he insists that he has witnessed the changes `` the way to happiness '' has inspired in people . he also maintains that the scientologists , many of whom he calls friends , are successful at outreach and getting desired results . at kennedy 's c. l. kennedy center , free tutoring based on hubbard 's `` study tech '' philosophies is provided to dozens of children and some adults . kennedy 's daughter , jimirra , is one of the instructors . she said `` study tech '' and the scientology orientation classes she attended helped her graduate from high school and become a poised woman . though jimirra kennedy insists she does not ascribe to the religious side of scientology , she still considers herself , at least in part , scientologist . `` we say this all the time and i know my father says this , but i am like a pentecostal scientologist , that 's what we are . '' critics like ross are alarmed by such a blurring of the lines . they consider it a marketing win for scientology . in houston , mclaughlin says he is not one to argue with success . driven by a need to address the rampant drug problem in his community , mclaughlin spent years searching for a solution before he discovered `` narconon , '' scientology 's nonprofit drug rehab center , in 2001 . mclaughlin trained at narconon and brought the techniques back to his community to launch `` first step faith step , '' a program that combines hubbard 's methods with the teachings of christianity . he claims a 70 - to 80-percent rehabilitation success rate . kennedy and mclaughlin said they have never lost a member of their congregations to scientology . `` i think that they truly believe that this may help their communities , but in my opinion , they 're naïve , '' ross said . scientologists , he added , `` have their own agenda . '' the church of scientology would not grant cnn an interview , nor would its representatives answer questions about the hubbard-based programs . e-mail to a friend .

189	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- national hurricane center director bill proenza left his position monday , just days after nearly half of the nhc staff signed a petition calling for his ouster . hurricane center bill proenza left his job as director monday . proenza is still employed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration -- a parent organization of the nhc -- but he is currently on leave , said noaa spokesman anson franklin . deputy director ed rappaport has been temporarily placed in charge . proenza , 62 , became the director in january after the retirement of max mayfield . proenza caused an uproar last month with comments about a key hurricane satellite called quikscat . the satellite is five years beyond its life expectancy and operating on a backup transmitter . proenza said if it were to fail , forecast tracks could be thrown off by as much as 16 percent . he said washington reprimanded him for the remarks : `` they wanted me to be quiet about it . '' but one of the center 's longtime forecasters said proenza 's comments were misguided . `` quikscat is another tool that we use to forecast , '' lixion avila said . `` the forecast will not be degraded if we do n't have the quikscat . '' last week , the commerce department launched an unscheduled review of the hurricane center after word of the staff 's dissatisfaction started to become public . his staffers on thursday issued a petition calling for him to step down . watch how proenza lost the confidence of his staff '' the petition said the center 's `` effective functioning '' is at stake as the atlantic hurricane season heads toward its peak . `` the undersigned staff ... has concluded that the center needs a new director , and with the heart of the hurricane season fast approaching , urges the department of commerce to make this happen as quickly as possible , '' said the petition , which was signed by twenty-three people , including four of five senior hurricane specialists . hurricane center staffers told cnn 's john zarella they were unhappy not only about his comments about the quikscat , but also about the environment at the center -- one characterized by closed doors and the public airing of dirty laundry . proenza on friday told cnn he had contacted his superiors in washington about `` ways to move forward , '' but added , `` i am not going to resign .

190	el calaboz , texas -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- eloisa tamez said she is n't scared anymore , just determined . `` i am not backing down , '' she said . the u.s. government wants to build a border fence like this one . about 100 landowners are fighting it . tamez owns three acres of land along the texas-mexico border where the department of homeland security would like to build a border fence . the property is a remnant of a 12,000-acre grant from spain to her family in 1767 , before the united states even existed . `` it is my history . it is my heritage , '' tamez said . this week , the justice department began legal action against landowners and municipalities who have refused to give government surveyors access to their land . tamez expects she will be sued sometime soon , but she is not intimidated . asked how long she will fight , she said , `` as long as i have to . '' michael chertoff , the secretary of homeland security , said the fence will not be stopped by opponents like tamez . `` can we simply abandon an enterprise because it is a problem for a particular individual ? '' chertoff told cnn . `` i do n't think i can accept that . '' watch chertoff say it 's `` civic responsibility '' to give up land '' chertoff believes a fence would curb the steady stream of illegal immigrants making their way across the border and lessen the flow of drugs . he also argues it will increase the safety of border patrol agents who have faced increasing violence . the government wants to build 700 miles of fence along the mexican border , including 370 miles of it by the end of this year . about 70 miles of fence is to be built in the rio grande valley by year 's end , if the government gets its way . the rio grande forms a natural barrier along this stretch of the border , but in some places it is narrow enough to swim across . on the banks of the river there is ample evidence that people do so . piles of underwear lie discarded by swimmers after they make it across . the swimmers change into dry clothes they have carried across in plastic bags . then they disappear into the united states . the border patrol has stepped up its efforts in the rio grande valley with more lights , and sensors to pick up movement . a levee built along the river has a muddy road on top used by border patrol vehicles to patrol the area . richard cortez , the mayor of the border town of mcallen , texas , believes hiring more border patrol agents , deepening the rio grande , and clearing its banks of tall vegetation would provide better border protection than the fence . cortez calls the fence `` a multibillion-dollar speed bump , '' which will slow , but not stop , illegal immigration . `` it is a false sense of security , '' he said . `` america will not be safe . america will continue to waste resources on something that is not going to work .

'' in addition to the american , an iraqi and at least three lebanese were among those wounded in the blast , according to a western diplomatic source . video of the scene showed several damaged cars , including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal . a nearby high-rise building also sustained damage . mohammed chatah , senior adviser to lebanese prime minister fouad siniora , pointed out that the attack happened during `` a major political crisis '' in lebanon , which has been without a president for nearly eight weeks amid a bitter political feud . `` this explosion just exacerbates a difficult situation , '' chatah told cnn . tuesday 's blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against pro-western , anti-syrian targets in the lebanese capital . most recently , an explosion in beirut 's christian suburb of baabda killed brig. gen. francois al-hajj , the head of operations for the lebanese army , and his bodyguard on december 12 . al-hajj was believed to be a top candidate to take over as army commander in the event current commander gen. michel suleiman was elected to replace emile lahoud as president . lebanon has been in the midst of a political crisis as pro- and anti-syrian lawmakers in parliament are locked in a battle to elect a new president . the nation has been without a president since november 23 , when the pro-syrian lahoud stepped down at the end of his term . in february 2005 , the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri in beirut sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of syrian forces from lebanon . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's anthony mills in beirut and elise labott in washington contributed to this report .
195	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- sens. hillary clinton and barack obama will duel for super tuesday votes thursday night as the democratic presidential hopefuls face off for the first time together minus former sen. john edwards . thursday 's debate is taking place at the kodak theatre in los angeles , california . the debate -- sponsored by cnn , the los angeles times and politico -- starts at 8 p.m. et thursday on cnn and cnn.com . cnn 's wolf blitzer is the moderator . the event is the first democratic debate since obama 's convincing victory saturday in south carolina . on tuesday , clinton won the florida primary , a contest her campaign said helped the senator regain momentum even though it awarded no delegates . the forum at the kodak theatre in hollywood comes hours after the obama campaign revealed it had raised $ 32 million in january from roughly 170,000 new donors . that amount will allow obama to expand his television ad buys greatly in the 20-plus states holding primaries or caucuses tuesday . watch a time-lapse construction of the debate set '' the clinton campaign would not indicate how much money it had raised in the same time period . mike gravel , the other democratic presidential candidate still in the race , was not invited to participate in the debate because he did not meet certain criteria , including support in national polls . in a cnn/opinion research corporation poll conducted january 14-17 , gravel received less than 1 percent . edwards suspended his presidential run wednesday in new orleans , louisiana , but he did n't endorse any candidate despite what aides described as furious lobbying campaigns by obama and clinton . thursday 's debate may be slightly more restrained than last week 's brutal showdown . following her south carolina loss , clinton has largely steered clear of opportunities to take aim at obama . former president bill clinton also has avoided criticizing his wife 's rival after dominating headlines with his attacks in the days before the south carolina vote . the economy is likely to dominate thursday 's debate , as both candidates look to appeal to supporters of edwards and his brand of economic populism . clinton and obama have split victories in their parties ' early-voting states : obama has won in iowa and south carolina , and clinton has won in new hampshire , nevada , michigan and florida . but the michigan and florida contests awarded no delegates , and all major democratic presidential candidates pledged to avoid campaigning in those states following national party penalties against them for moving up their contests so early . clinton was the only major candidate to appear on the michigan ballot . obama is leading clinton in the number of pledged delegates -- those awarded based on primary or caucus votes . clinton has the edge when superdelegates are factored in . -lrb- superdelegates are party leaders and elected officials who are not obligated to support a particular candidate . they can change their decisions at any time leading up to the democratic national convention in august . -rrb- . to date , obama has won an estimated 63 national convention delegates as a result of primary or caucus votes , while clinton has earned an estimated 48 delegates . clinton , however , has the overall lead in delegates -- 232 to 158 -- when superdelegates are included . with solid fundraising numbers and a nod from sen. edward kennedy of massachusetts this week , obama will be making the claim he holds the front-runner title . but clinton -- who has led in national surveys for much of the race -- will be making her case as well . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's rebecca sinderbrand contributed to this report .

204	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it may take a lot of frequent-flier miles , a penchant for cold places , a tolerance of taxes and regular doses of chocolate , but happiness could be within reach . however , it 's not where most people might expect . journalist eric weiner says he wanted to explore the relationship between place and happiness . just ask eric weiner , who made it his mission to find the most content places around the globe , uncovering lots of surprises along the way . hungering for a tropical paradise ? a warm climate does n't necessarily make a happy nation , weiner said . thinking of moving to a wealthy state ? money can degrade happiness , he found . weiner , who wrote the book , `` the geography of bliss : one grump 's search for the happiest places in the world , '' began his quest for very personal reasons . `` i 'm an unhappy person , so it 's kind of what prompts a hungry person to search for food , '' he said . weiner spent 10 years as a foreign correspondent for national public radio , a job that took him to some of the least happy places in the world . it was enough to send him on a yearlong journey to look for just the opposite . weiner mapped out his quest with a combination of scientific and personal methods , choosing some countries because they traditionally score high on happiness surveys and selecting others to see how factors like money play a role . a world map of happiness , based on 100 different studies and produced by britain 's university of leicester in 2006 , listed denmark as the world 's happiest nation . but for weiner , the place where he felt the most bliss was a toss-up between bhutan and iceland , countries that ranked eighth and fourth , respectively , on the happiness map . weiner 's list of favorites also included thailand , india and switzerland . see photos of his favorites and listen to him explain why they 're happy '' his top two picks , though very different countries , have unconventional paths to happiness , he said . `` bhutan is probably the closest thing on earth to shangri-la , that fictional paradise , '' weiner explained . he pointed out that while other countries focus on their gross domestic product , the himalayan kingdom proudly touts its policy of `` gross national happiness . '' `` the bhutanese very much believe that happiness should be part and parcel of every government decision , '' weiner said . cold place , warm relationships . thousands of miles away , weiner found happiness in a very different environment , marveling at the creativity and `` coziness '' of iceland . `` everyone in iceland is a poet , '' weiner recalled . he visited the country during winter and said he found a certain beauty in the cold and the darkness . such a chilly climate usually encourages warm relationships , weiner found . `` the cold inspires people to cooperate , traditionally . if you go back a few hundred years , people in cold climates have to cooperate or they die together . it 's that simple , '' he said . weiner found a different flavor of happiness in switzerland , where he discovered people are content partly because everything runs like clockwork . simple pleasures like trains arriving on time contributed to national happiness , he said . but there may be a much sweeter reason why switzerland is a happy place . `` the swiss eat a lot of chocolate , and let 's not forget that , '' weiner said . he was also impressed with how the swiss view money . `` their attitude is that if you 've got it , hide it . while our attitude is if you 've got it , flaunt it , '' weiner said , comparing the swiss to americans . weiner called the united states , which came in at no. 23 on the university of leicester 's world map of happiness , a nation that `` is not as happy as it is wealthy . '' the impact of wealth and taxes . the relationship between money and happiness took weiner to the middle east and qatar , a country with one of the highest per capita incomes in the world , thanks to oil and natural gas revenues , according to the cia world factbook . `` i went there specifically to examine what happens when the entire country wins the lottery , '' weiner said . he found the wealth made the residents comfortable , but also degraded their level of contentment . `` most of our happiness is derived from our relationships with other people , '' weiner said . `` the money in qatar has allowed them to wall themselves off , literally and figuratively , from other people . ... that 's not a recipe for happiness . '' there are no income taxes in qatar , but that 's not a cause for contentment , weiner found . some taxation is necessary for happiness because it 's a way of being invested in a place , he argued . `` you 're giving money to someone else , a government , and you 're trusting them to do something good with it , '' weiner said . `` in a country where there 's no taxation at all , people do n't have vested interests in how well the government performs . you ca n't say , ` hey , those are my tax dollars at work . ' '' quest creates buzz . weiner 's book has struck a chord , recently rising to the top 10 of the new york times nonfiction best-seller list . an expert who studies happiness said part of the book 's appeal may lie in how weiner mapped out his journey . `` he arranges an interesting itinerary because he uses science as his compass , '' said daniel gilbert , a psychology professor at harvard university and the author of `` stumbling on happiness . '' gilbert said it 's only recently that a combination of biology , sociology and psychology has been able to answer the `` where 's and why 's '' of happiness , a subject that has always fascinated people . `` the quest for happiness is the central preoccupation of human beings and has been for as long as there have been human beings , '' gilbert said . he echoed weiner 's findings that bliss is other people . `` everyone has been telling us for the longest time that happiness is about social relationships , well , bingo , they 're right , '' gilbert said . meanwhile , after a year of exploring some of the world 's happiest places , weiner -- the self-described `` grump '' -- said his mind-set has improved somewhat . `` i would describe myself as a recovering grump , '' weiner said . `` at this point , i think i am marginally happier than before i started the project .

'' the u.s. embassy in beirut issued a statement saying : `` it is not a coincidence that these attacks target those figures who have been working to secure lebanon 's independence from renewed syrian hegemony . we note with concern that many lebanese politicians allied with syria have in fact warned that murder and violence would be the results of any effort to exercise genuine parliamentary democracy . '' and u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , in a written statement , said : `` the bombing that claimed these lives was another act in a campaign of terror by those who want to turn back the clock on lebanon 's hard-won democratic gains .

'' i read `` namesake '' while in huge grief with the death of a beloved person to me -lsb- mira 's mother in law -rsb- . it was at that state of mourning that i picked up this novel , and in it jhumpa writes really acutely of a loss of a parent in a foreign country , and i thought i had been understood by someone . it was also a story that linked the two cities in which i had grown up -- calcutta and new york city -- and it was almost certainly the road that i had traveled . it just spoke to me and i felt compelled to do this film . a few months later we were shooting it . cnn : it 's filmed in both india and new york , such different cultures . tell us about the universal themes involved during the film . nair : well , the story of movement and crossings is as old as the hills . it 's a tale of millions of us that have left one home for another , and tried to find out who we are through these places . then when we have children , life gets more interesting . it is about growing up through our adult lives and our children 's lives . it is also equally a love story between two people who come from a culture who do n't send roses and diamonds for love ; who sit at a kitchen table and look at each other . it 's about that generation of parents who have that stillness about one another , versus the clang and hustle of young gogol who is 15 and grows up in an american world because he wishes to be american . that flow -- that see-saw between parents and children , that 's what `` the namesake '' is about . cnn : tell us about casting the role of gogol . nair : well , kal penn plays gogol and he 's known as a comic star , but i had no idea that he existed until my 15-year-old son said , `` this has to be your gogol . '' i did n't take him seriously at all until every night the campaign mounted at home : `` tell me in the morning it 's kal penn !

212	hollywood , florida -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a man serving a life sentence for robbing a drugstore has confessed to overpowering and fatally shooting a deputy who was taking him to court wednesday , authorities said . michael mazza , 40 , was arrested outside a pawn shop in hollywood , florida , hours after the death of broward county deputy paul rein sparked a massive manhunt . it was the third shooting of a broward county sheriff 's deputy in four months , and the second fatality . the incident happened as mazza was being taken to the second day of his trial in connection with the armed robbery of a coral springs bank , sheriff al lamberti said . mazza was being transported in a medical van because of a medical condition , lamberti said . the driver 's compartment of the van was separated from the back by a cage or grill . mazza and rein left about 8:05 a.m. , lamberti said . minutes later , a truck driver who saw all or part of the altercation near pompano beach called 911 . `` all of this transpired within six minutes . that 's all it took , '' lamberti said . the struggle began when rein apparently pulled the medical transport van over at an intersection . the deputy 's body showed other injuries from the fight -- a broken finger , bruises and cuts , lamberti said . mazza allegedly took rein 's service weapon away from him and shot him , authorities said . although two shots were fired , rein was shot only once , the bullet entering his upper chest and exiting his lower back , lamberti told reporters . after the shooting , mazza is believed to have thrown rein from the van and driven away . a city public works employee later spotted the blood-spattered van in fort lauderdale , lamberti said . mazza , meanwhile , is believed to have hitchhiked his way down to hollywood , about 20 miles away . he approached a man at a pawn shop and asked for a ride . the man , who was headed to a second pawn shop , agreed . when the man arrived at the second pawn shop , he left mazza in the car and went inside , lamberti said . as he was talking to the clerk , a television in the shop began broadcasting news about the deputy 's shooting , and showed a picture of mazza , he said . the man `` tells the clerk , ` hey , i have that guy in my car , ' '' lamberti said . he went back to the car , took his keys , came back and told the clerk to call police . mazza was arrested shortly afterward . rein 's gun was found with mazza in the man 's car , the sheriff said . mazza faces charges including first-degree murder and escape , lamberti said . he was being interviewed by police wednesday afternoon and was to appear before a judge at some point , he said , and afterward would be transported to dade county jail . because the shooting was `` an emotionally charged event for all of us ... we feel it 's probably better that he be housed at another facility outside of broward county , '' lamberti said , and dade county agreed to house him . mazza initially was reluctant to talk to authorities , but later agreed , and confessed to shooting rein , the sheriff said . he offered no details . lamberti said mazza was serving a life sentence for robbing a drugstore in coconut creek , correcting his earlier statement that mazza was serving two life sentences . he was on trial for robbery of the coral springs bank . broward county also has a pending case against mazza -- a february drugstore robbery in pompano beach , he said . mazza was dressed in civilian clothes -- a suit -- rather than jail scrubs wednesday because he had a court date , authorities have said . when caught , however , mazza was wearing a t-shirt , shorts and sneakers , lamberti told reporters . police are investigating whether he had planned the escape in advance and whether anyone helped him . rein 's co-workers told reporters he was `` in outstanding condition physically . '' the sheriff 's office has fitness-for-duty standards that deputies must meet . broward county deputies conduct some 400 to 500 inmate court transports a day -- one deputy transporting up to a handful of inmates , lamberti said . thin staffing and scant resources prevent more than one deputy being involved , he said . `` it 's a routine thing , '' lamberti said . `` but it shows , in this profession , nothing is routine , whether it be a domestic , a traffic stop or just transporting an inmate to court . '' as news of the escape broke , all 273 schools in broward county went on lockdown , according to nadine drew , a spokeswoman for the school system . lamberti said rein 's wife spoke to her husband by cell phone just 10 minutes before he was shot . `` she said you never think it 's going to happen to you , '' the sheriff said . the deputy was memorialized wednesday on the web site of the broward county sheriff 's office . visitors to the site were greeted by a photo of rein , with a caption saying , `` husband . father . friend .

214	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a saudi arabian human rights attorney is asking the government to allow him to represent a woman who was gang-raped -- and then sentenced to prison for speaking out about the case . human rights groups want saudi arabia 's king abdullah to drop charges against the rape victim . the attorney , abdulrahman al-lahim , had his license revoked last week by a judge for speaking to the saudi-controlled media about the case , al-lahim told cnn . the judge more than doubled the sentence against al-lahim 's 19-year-old client because she spoke to the media about the case , a court source told arab news , an english-language middle eastern daily newspaper . the woman -- who was initially sentenced in october 2006 to 90 lashes -- had her sentenced increased to 200 lashes and was ordered to serve six months in prison under saudi arabia 's strict islamic law . `` we were shocked , '' al-lahim said of the increased sentence . cnn has been unable to reach saudi government officials for comment on this report , despite repeated requests . watch the emotional toll the crime took on the rape victim '' al-lahim had petitioned the court to sentence the attackers to the death penalty , but instead the court agreed to increase their jail sentences , which had been two to three years , to two to nine years , al-lahim said . the case has sparked outrage among human rights groups . `` barring the lawyer from representing the victim in court is almost equivalent to the rape crime itself , '' said fawzeyah al-oyouni , founding member of the newly formed saudi association for the defense of women 's rights . `` this is not just about the girl , it 's about every woman in saudi arabia , '' she said . `` we 're fearing for our lives and the lives of our sisters and our daughters and every saudi woman out there . we 're afraid of going out in the streets . '' human rights watch said it has called on saudi arabia 's king abdullah `` to immediely void the verdict and drop all charges against the rape victim and to order the court to end its harassment of her lawyer . '' the woman , who is married , and an unrelated man were abducted and she was raped by a group of seven men more than a year ago , the lawyer said . the male victim was also given an increased sentence of 200 lashes and six months in prison , al-lahim said . the man and woman were attacked after they met so she could retrieve an old photograph of herself from him , according to al-lahim . citing phone records from the police investigation , al-lahim said the man was trying to blackmail his client . he noted the photo she was trying to retrieve was harmless and did not show his client in any compromising position . al-lahim said the man tried to blame his client for insisting on meeting him that day . it is illegal for a woman to meet with an unrelated male under saudi 's islamic law . al-lahim has been ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing at the ministry of justice next month , where he faces a possible three-year suspension and disbarment , according to human rights watch . he told cnn he has appealed to the ministry of justice to reinstate his law license and plans to meet with justice minister abdullah bin muhammad bin ibrahim al al-sheikh . `` currently she does n't have a lawyer , and i feel they 're doing this to isolate her and deprive her from her basic rights , '' he said . `` we will not accept this judgment and i 'll do my best to continue representing her because justice needs to take place . '' he said the handling of the case is a direct contradiction of judicial reforms announced by the saudi king earlier this month . `` the ministry of justice needs to have a very clear standing regarding this case because i consider this decision to be judiciary mutiny against the reform that king abdullah bin abdulaziz started and against saudi women who are being victimized because of such decisions , '' he said . saudi arabia 's islamic law or sharia is not written and , therefore , subject to a wide array of interpretations . human rights watch points out that a judge in jeddah threw out a lawyer simply because he was a member of the ismaili faith , a branch of shia islam . under saudi law , women are subject to numerous restrictions , including a strict dress code , a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man 's permission to travel or have surgery . women are also not allowed to testify in court unless it is about a private matter that was not observed by a man , and they are not allowed to vote . the saudi government recently has taken some steps toward bettering the situation of women in the kingdom , including the establishment earlier this year of special courts to handle domestic abuse cases , adoption of a new labor law that addresses working women 's rights and creation of a human rights commission . christoph wilcke of human rights watch praised the female rape victim and her attorney for speaking out about the case , which he said may be indicative of `` many injustices that we still do n't know about . '' `` it 's not only one court , it is the saudi government that is fully behind punishing a woman who 's been raped -lsb- and -rsb- punishing the lawyer who 's trying to help her and doing that both because they 've spoken to the media , '' wilcke told cnn . `` and if they had n't spoken to the media , we would n't know about it . '' shying away from criticism of key ally , state department spokesman sean mccormack called the case and the punishment `` surprising '' and `` astonishing . '' `` while this is a judicial procedure -- part of a judicial procedure -- overseas in courts outside of our country , still while it is very difficult to offer any detailed comment about this situation , i think most people would be quite astonished by the situation , '' mccormack said . `` i ca n't get involved in specific court cases in saudi arabia dealing with its own citizens . but most people here would be quite surprised to learn of the circumstances and then the punishment meted out , '' he said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's saad abedine and mohammed jamjoom contributed to this report .
215	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- jordan 's king hussein sent a secret message to president richard nixon in 1970 pleading with him to attack syria , according to declassified documents released wednesday by the former president 's library . president nixon works at his desk in the oval office in a june 1972 photograph . the papers are among about 10,000 documents released by the nixon presidential library , some of which offer harbingers of present-day events , such as concerns about terrorism and saudi arabia . library director timothy naftali said the documents describe challenges such as how to get the saudis more involved in solving the palestinian-israeli conflict , how to get them more engaged against terrorism , how to address the arab view that the united states always sides with israel and how to build up moderate palestinians to counter extremists . a 1973 diplomatic cable cites this objective : `` isolate and undermine terrorisms -lsb- sic -rsb- and commandos -lsb- sic -rsb- by establishing another , more stable and respectable palestinian political entity and political personality . '' documents detail u.s. efforts to persuade saudi arabia to move away from fatah , the military wing of the palestine liberation organization , because u.s. officials believed the plo was supporting the terrorist-linked , anti-israel group black september , referred to as bso . the document , a u.s. state department telegram from the embassy in jeddah to washington reads , `` bso and fatah -lsb- are -rsb- now linked together in vicious effort to create chaos and uncertainty . one might wonder whether central objective bso conspiracy was not to erase any slight progress toward middle east peace . '' the document release was intended to coincide with mideast peace summit among palestinian , israeli and other mideast leaders in maryland , naftali said . the nixon white house also was adjusting to israel 's acquisition of a nuclear weapon . `` we are declassifying the records today that laid the basis for richard nixon 's decision in 1969 to accept the fact , a fact of life , that israel had a bomb , a nuclear device , '' said naftali . `` that , of course , is very important with what 's going on in annapolis . '' `` even though it is clear from the documents that the united states government did not encourage israel to acquire a nuclear deterrent , it became a fact of life , '' naftali said . `` there are materials here that show how our government , 30 years ago , dealt with this very , very difficult problem . '' rather than openly declare itself as a nuclear power , israel still maintains a strategic ambiguity over its nuclear weapons capability . in 1970 , as king hussein dealt with threats by both palestinian refugees in his country and syrian military forces crossing jordan 's border , the king asked `` the united states and great britain to intervene in the war in jordan , asking the united states , in fact , to attack syria , '' naftali said . `` syria had invaded jordan and the jordanian king , facing what he felt was a military rout , said please help us in any way possible . '' the telegram indicates that hussein himself called a u.s. official at 3 a.m. to ask for american or british help . `` situation deteriorating dangerously following syrian massive invasion ... , '' the document said . `` i request immediate physical intervention both land and air ... to safeguard sovereignty , territorial integrity and independence of jordan . immediate air strikes on invading forces from any quarter plus air cover are imperative . '' the library has withheld the nixon documents from public access until wednesday and have been reviewed for release and/or declassified , naftali said . nixon served as president from january 20 , 1969 , to august 9 , 1974 , when he resigned under political pressure during the watergate scandal -- the only u.s. president to do so . he died in 1994 after suffering a stroke at the age of 81 . e-mail to a friend .
216	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the cia asked the justice department to investigate whether former operative john kiriakou illegally disclosed classified information when he talked about the waterboarding of a terrorism suspect , government officials say . ex-cia agent john kiriakou says he underwent waterboarding in training and cracked in a few seconds . kiriakou spoke last week with several news organizations , including cnn , after the cia disclosed that videotapes of certain interrogations were destroyed in 2005 . that revelation has prompted new calls for investigations on capitol hill . the bush administration appeared in u.s. district court on friday to answer a judge 's questions about the tapes ' destruction . speaking to cnn last week , kiriakou said that u.s. interrogators drew valuable information from al qaeda captive abu zubayda by `` waterboarding '' him . but kiriakou said the procedure amounts to torture and should be stopped . waterboarding involves pouring a stream of water onto the cellophane-covered face of a suspect to induce the sensation of drowning , kiriakou said . watch how a suspect is waterboarded '' kiriakou told cnn he was unaware that cia interrogations were being taped , but that the tapes should have been kept `` as a matter of historical record . '' kiriakou 's attorney mark zaid told cnn that the referral of the case to the justice department is standard procedure . `` a criminal referral from the cia would be both expected and normal under the circumstances , '' zaid said in a written statement . `` it is a routine act that the cia undertakes even when they know no violation has occurred . '' zaid added that the question is whether the justice department will proceed , and that such a decision `` must be measured carefully . '' `` doing so will unlock a pandora 's box that will place a spotlight on the information in question as to the lawfulness of the alleged conduct and the activities of those involved . '' he said . `` there would also exist a challenge regarding whether mr. kiriakou was being targeted for exercising his first amendment rights . '' cia officers who leave the agency are required to sign documents promising never to divulge classified information . written comments are cleared by an agency review board before publication , and unscripted oral comments -- such as television interviews -- are referred to the justice department after the fact . about one case a week is referred to the justice department , and an investigation could take months to complete , a source in the intelligence community said . for private citizens found to be in violation of the secrecy standard , penalties can range from loss of security clearances to criminal prosecution leading to jail time . justice department spokesman dean boyd said the department has no comment on the kiriakou matter , and routinely refuses comment on whether another agency has referred a case . kiriakou said he was not present when other agents used the waterboarding technique on abu zubayda , but that he was told the al qaeda suspect lasted 30 or 35 seconds . kiriakou said he himself was subjected to the treatment during his training , and lasted about five seconds before having to stop . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's kelli arena contributed to this report .
217	san francisco , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- `` human error factors '' probably were involved in a ship crash and oil spill that killed nearly 400 birds in san francisco bay and prompted a federal criminal probe , the u.s. coast guard said monday . a worker checks oil cleanup gear near the golden gate bridge thursday in san francisco , california . the u.s. attorney in san francisco has opened a federal criminal investigation into wednesday 's crash of the mv cosco busan to determine whether the captain and crew violated federal maritime laws . although not officially detained , the captain and crew were barred by law from leaving the vessel , which is docked for repairs in oakland , the coast guard said . `` you had a competently manned ship with a pilot , all the navigation and sensors , '' said adm. thad allen , coast guard commandant . there were `` probably some human error factors , but we need to determine the facts , because there 's no reason a ship like that should have collided with the bridge . '' watch allen on the criminal probe '' the cosco busan was departing oakland for south korea when it struck a tower supporting the western suspension span of the bay bridge , cutting a 212-foot , 12-foot wide gash in the ship 's side . about 58,000 gallons of heavy-duty bunker oil poured out of the vessel as it was moored near treasure island . see where oil spilled '' the oil sickened birds and formed globules on more than 20 of the area 's beaches . it oozed along the san francisco city waterfront and out of the bay , beneath the golden gate bridge toward marin county . allen defended the coast guard against criticism of its response to the spill . some lawmakers , including one of the state 's u.s. senators , democrat barbara boxer , have criticized the coast guard 's handling of the collision and resulting spill . boxer said the coast guard initially reported that the ship 's owner had said only 140 gallons had spilled from the cosco busan . boxer and house speaker nancy pelosi of california have called for congressional hearings into the accident and resulting spill . although allen conceded some confusion in the coast guard 's communication , he said it did not reflect their response . `` response was set into play within an hour of the event itself , '' allen said monday . regarding the initial low estimate of 140 gallons of lost oil , allen said heavy fog and damage to the ship 's tanks hindered initial aerial and on-ground evaluations of how much oil had leaked from the ship . in addition to federal prosecutors , the national transportation safety board is investigating the accident , and ntsb spokeswoman debbie hersman said sunday that agency was interviewing the pilot , the ship 's crew , and other pilots who were on the water at the time of wednesday 's crash . see photos of oil coating the bay '' the crew had been on its inaugural voyage on the ship , which the current owner purchased last month , hersman said . the ntsb also intends to review the ship 's voyage data recorder , which should have recorded captain and crew conversations on the bridge and other information in the 12 hours leading up to the bridge collision , hersman said . the oil spill has sparked concern among local officials and environmentalists . as of sunday , 23 beaches in the area remained closed . angel island state park , the bay 's largest island , reopened monday , the coast guard said . gov. arnold schwarzenegger has declared a state of emergency , freeing money to clean up the spill . seven miles of containment boom stretched across the bay has collected more than 12,271 gallons of oil so far , and another 4,000 gallons have evaporated , officials said . nearly 400 dead birds have been recovered from the bay , while another 500 birds have been rescued alive but soaked in oil , according to lisa curtis , administrator of the department of fish and games office of spill prevention and response . in 1989 , the oil tanker exxon valdez ran aground and fouled alaska 's prince william sound with almost 11 million gallons of crude -- the nation 's worst ever oil spill . thousands of birds and animals died in the disaster , according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration . often birds and animals are threatened when they come in contact with the oil and swallow it as they try to clean themselves , said the noaa web site . in addition to birds , oil spills can be very harmful to fish and shellfish , noaa said . twenty wildlife teams were scheduled monday to be the bay , working to find sick birds so they can be rehabilitated , curtis said . on sunday , the state 's other u.s. senator and a leading coast guard official decried the accident . `` this an incident which , in my view , should not have happened , '' sen. dianne feinstein , d-california , said sunday after being briefed by coast guard officials . rear adm. craig e. bone , the coast guard 's director of inspection and compliance , echoed feinstein 's comments . `` this incident should have never ever occurred , '' he said . `` there 's systems , there 's capabilities , there 's licensed operators , there 's a pilot on board the vessel , there 's the capacity and the capability to safely navigate through this port and waterways every day . '' he added , `` but we have to move beyond the incident and the fact that it occurred and move forward into the response .

219	atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the rev. james orange , a civil rights activist whose 1965 jailing sparked a fatal protest that ultimately led to the famed selma-to-montgomery march and the voting rights act , died saturday at atlanta 's crawford long hospital , the southern christian leadership conference said in a statement . he was 65 . orange was a native of birmingham , alabama , `` who resided in southwest atlanta for four decades while fighting the good fight for equality and social justice for all mankind , '' said the sclc , a civil rights organization . orange was arrested and jailed in perry county , alabama , in 1965 on charges of disorderly conduct and contributing to the delinquency of minors for enlisting students to aid in voting rights drives . as rumors spread that orange would be lynched , civil rights activists organized a march to support him . however , the marchers clashed with alabama state troopers during the february 18 demonstration , and a young black man , jimmie lee jackson , was shot in the stomach . `` i could hear the singing and the commotion , '' orange told cnn last year . `` once the tear gas was flying and the shots started , i could n't tell what was going on . '' jackson , 26 , died eight days later . witnesses said jackson 's grandfather , who was active in the voting rights movement , had been beaten by troopers , and jackson was trying to get him to the hospital . the anger resulting from jackson 's death led civil rights leaders , including the rev. martin luther king jr. , to organize the selma-to-montgomery , alabama , voting rights march . the first attempt at that march was broken up by club-wielding state troopers and sheriff 's deputies , a melee that became known as `` bloody sunday . '' `` jimmie 's death is the reason that bloody sunday took place , '' orange said . `` had he not died , there would never have been a bloody sunday .

'' a goodwill ambassador for the u.n. high commissioner for refugees , jolie wants to find ways to help the agency be more active inside war-torn iraq . watch cnn 's exclusive interview with jolie '' sunni-shiite sectarian violence in the country has sparked a displacement crisis that is considered the most significant in the middle east since the 1948 creation of israel . more than 4.2 million iraqis have fled their homes , around 2 million to neighboring states , mostly syria and jordan , and another 2.2 million displaced inside iraq . the flight was aggravated by the february 2006 bombing of a shiite shrine in samarra , an attack that stoked pitched sectarian warfare . many of the internally displaced live precarious lives amid conditions of squalor , crowded into camps and slums that often lack basic necessities , such as proper food , health care and shelter . `` how iraq settles in the years to come is going to affect the entire middle east , '' said jolie . `` it 's in our best interest to address a humanitarian crisis on this scale because displacement can lead to a lot of instability and aggression . '' read transcript of interview . jolie has been working to help draw attention to the problem and has called for governments to bolster their support of the u.n.h.c.r. . in august , jolie first visited iraq and syria to get a sense of the problem . she heard stories from refugees about their plight . watch as jolie lunches with troops '' this visit to iraq is focusing on the problems of the internally displaced , 58 percent of whom are under age 12 . a top issue for the agency is getting better security . jolie is talking with u.s. officials , including top u.s. gen. david petraeus , about that issue , and are willing to provide such security which she said `` needs to be addressed and solved . '' the iraqi government needs to empower agencies that deal with migration to address the concerns of the displaced -- but that has not happened yet , she said . jolie said it was crucial that the government prepare a plan to deal with refugees who return home from syria and jordan and find that their homes are `` occupied '' by others or `` bombed out . '' she emphasizes the way in which these people are resettled will have `` broad implications '' in the region . jolie also is talking to people about moving forward the u.s. effort to resettle iraqi refugees in the united states , which has set a goal of taking in 12,000 of those people by september . only 375 have been admitted so far . `` i have to believe there are people working toward that goal , '' she said . international agencies , such as the united nations and the arab league , and many countries in the region and in europe are addressing the refugee and the internally displaced persons ' crisis , and money is being allocated to iraq and host countries to help clothe , feed and house people . most of the refugees are in syria and jordan , and they reside in big cities like damascus and amman . the u.n.c.h.r. is trying to help governments in syria and jordan to cope with the influx , which has stretched the resources of institutions like schools and health systems . it is also attempting to help 41,000 non-iraqi refugees in iraq , such as palestinians and iranians . last month , the unhcr announced a plan to seek $ 261 million this year for its work to help these refugees . it has almost 350 staffers `` directly engaged in operations for iraq and the surrounding region .

222	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a six-month trial was launched this week that promises to transform the way luggage is tracked and monitored at london 's heathrow airport . as many as 28 in every 1,000 passengers do not arrive at their destination at the same time as their luggage . the trial -- run by baa and airline emirates -- is using rfid -lrb- radio-frequency identification -rrb- technology to tag baggage . this will allow staff to more accurately track bags passing through the airport . the crucial difference between rfid and the existing barcode system is its scanning accuracy . barcode tags can be easily damaged in transit and are also at risk of being covered when scanned . if not scanned , details must be entered manually into the system , adding time and error to the process . baa estimates that heathrow can read only 60 per cent of labels that pass through . rfid is reported to offer over 99 percent accuracy . the # 150,000 trial -- the first of its kind in the uk -- will continue for six months tracking bags for passengers traveling with emirates to and from dubai , and transferring through heathrow . a duplicate of the heathrow system has been installed at dubai airport . during the check-in process at heathrow terminal 3 , staff apply tags containing rfid chips to bags with information including the passenger 's name and route . the chips are then read on entry into the baggage system ; they are tracked as they move throughout ; and finally on leaving the system . as a result , says shaun cowlam , logistics director at heathrow airport , staff can know where a bag is at `` every moment of every day '' . baa is also considering introducing a sms text messaging service to keep passengers informed of where their bags are . when passengers arrive at heathrow , says cowlam , the idea will be to send passengers a text informing them what belt and what time their bags will arrive at . ultimately , the use of rfid could extend services to frequent flyers , and provide the means to added value services such as faster check-in , and even be integrated with secure collection and delivery . the main benefits , however , will be for travelers passing through major hubs such as heathrow and dubai , as this system offers better processing of baggage on transfer flights . emirates and baa are sharing the costs of the trial . but as vic sheppard , emirates vice president for uk and ireland says , `` cost is not an issue '' , especially considering the savings the airline is expected to achieve by reducing loss and repatriation of bags . and as cowlam adds : `` if we can introduce this across the whole network the costs will reduce significantly . '' hong kong international airport was one of the first to deploy rfid technology in 2005 . but as outlined in a recent survey by sita , rfid is being used in just 6 percent of the airports surveyed . `` for this system to really take off we need other airports and other airlines to embrace the technology , '' says cowlam . that widespread adoption may not be far off . the sita survey indicated that rfid tags will be used in 45 percent of airports by the end of 2009 . it 's still early days , but baa and emirates are optimistic for rfid 's future in airports . `` there have been giant strides in the technology in aviation in recent years . but in the last few decades there has n't been any advancement in the methods adopted for baggage handling , '' says sheppard . `` this is a major step forward .

223	beirut , lebanon -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- supporters and opponents of lebanon 's pro-western government appeared to split seats on sunday as lebanese voters went to the polls to replace two ruling-party lawmakers assassinated in recent months . lebanese women wait in line to cast their votes in beirut . voters in beirut sent pro-government candidate mohammed al-amin itani to parliament to replace walid eido , who was killed in a june bombing . both eido , a sunni muslim , and itani are members of the bloc led by saad hariri -- the son of former prime minister rafik hariri , whose 2005 killing triggered lebanon 's current wave of political upheaval . but in metn , a maronite christian suburb east of the capital , anti-government candidate camille khouri upset former president amin gemayel by a few hundred votes , lebanese television network lbc reported . khouri is a member of the free patriotic movement , the anti-government party led by former lebanese army gen. michel aoun . aoun has said he will run for president of lebanon -- and since the post is chosen by members of parliament , sunday 's results were closely watched . gemayel was seeking the seat held by his son pierre , who served as industry minister in the government of prime minister fouad siniora before being gunned down in his car in november 2006 . he served as president from 1982 to 1988 , during the civil war in lebanon . his brother , bashir gemayel , was elected president in 1982 but was assassinated before he could take office . eido and gemayel were among several lebanese political figures killed since the february 2005 killing of the elder hariri . all were critical of syria 's influence in lebanon , and their supporters blamed damascus for their deaths -- allegations the syrians and their allies in lebanon denied . hariri 's killing triggered a wave of protests against syria known as the `` cedar revolution , '' which brought siniora 's government to power and forced syria to withdraw the garrison it kept in lebanon for three decades . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's nada husseini contributed to this report .

225	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- city officials in new york have denied iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's request to visit the site of the destroyed world trade center next week , a police spokesman said wednesday . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad asked to visit ground zero , but new york city officials said no . the controversial , outspoken president wanted to `` pay his respects '' and lay a wreath at the site of the 2001 al qaeda attacks during his visit to the u.n. general assembly , police commissioner raymond kelly said , citing iranian officials . but workers are rebuilding the foundations of the site , `` and it would not be possible for him to go where other people do n't go , '' kelly told cnn . iranian officials have not put in any additional requests to visit the public platforms at ground zero , police spokesman paul browne told cnn . but , he said , `` if there were a further request , we 'd reject it '' because of security fears . watch why new york said no to iranian leader '' the iranian mission to the u.n. said it had not been told of the decision , but in a statement issued wednesday evening , it called the rejection `` unfortunate . '' iran is ruled by a shiite muslim government hostile to the fundamentalist sunni al qaeda . ahmadinejad 's predecessor at the time of the september 11 attacks , mohammed khatami , condemned them , and tehran cooperated with the u.s.-led campaign to topple al qaeda 's taliban allies in afghanistan that followed . the united states and iran have not had formal diplomatic relations since 1980 after iranian militants stormed the united states embassy in tehran and held americans hostage for 444 days . the united states considers iran a state sponsor of terrorism and has accused the country of meddling in iraq and in afghanistan where u.s. troops are battling taliban and al qaeda remnants more than six years after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks . more than 2,700 people died in the attack on the world trade center , when al qaeda terrorists flew hijacked passenger jets into the twin towers . a third jet hit the pentagon , and a fourth crashed in a pennsylvania field after passengers resisted their hijackers . `` it is appalling that president ahmadinejad , one of the world 's leading sponsors of terror , would find it appropriate to visit this hallowed ground , '' state department spokesman tom casey said . several presidential candidates also condemned the requested visit . hillary clinton , the new york senator and democratic front-runner , called the request `` unacceptable . '' former massachusetts gov. mitt romney , a leading republican , called it `` shockingly audacious . '' and former mayor rudy giuliani -- whose leadership after the attacks is the cornerstone of his gop presidential bid -- said that `` under no circumstances '' should ahmadinejad be allowed to visit the world trade center site . zalmay khalilzad , the u.s. ambassador to the united nations , said the site should not be `` used as a photo op . '' numerous critics have attacked ahmadinejad 's hard-line anti-israel stance and his insistence that iran will defy u.n. demands that it halt its production of enriched uranium . iran insists it is producing nuclear fuel for civilian power plants , but washington accuses tehran of trying to produce a nuclear bomb . e-mail to a friend . cnn correspondent deborah feyerick contributed to this report .
226	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a florida judge friday handed a legal victory to a former astronaut accused of assaulting a romantic rival , ruling evidence found in her car and statements she made to police after her arrest were inadmissible at trial . lisa nowak , accused of using pepper spray against a romantic rival , is set to go on trial in april . ninth judicial circuit judge marc lubet ruled that all were unlawfully obtained . he said his decision stemmed from a variety of factors , most concerning police tactics in their interview of lisa nowak and the fact that no written consent was obtained to search her car . `` in each and every case , this court must ensure that the constitutional protections afforded by our forefathers are scrupulously honored , '' lubet wrote in his opinion . `` unfortunately , in this case those protections were not as thoroughly followed as the law demands . '' nowak , 44 , is accused of stalking air force capt. colleen shipman and using pepper spray against her in a parking lot at orlando international airport in florida on february 5 . she pleaded not guilty march 22 to charges of attempted kidnapping with intent to inflict bodily harm , battery and burglary of a vehicle using a weapon . her trial is set for april . if convicted , she would face a sentence of up to life in prison . her defense attorneys had claimed nowak 's comments to police and her consent to search her car were made under duress . during a hearing held in august , lubet heard testimony from , among others , nowak , shipman and orlando police detective william becton , who interviewed nowak after her arrest . lubet said in his ruling that when nowak asked becton if she needed an attorney during the interview , he failed to answer her question in a `` simple and straightforward manner . '' `` there was a concerted effort to minimize and downplay the significance of the miranda rights by referring to these constitutional rights as ` formalities ' '' during the interview , lubet wrote . on the audiotape of the interview , there was no audible response from nowak on whether she understood that her statements could be used against her in court , and when she was asked whether anyone had threatened or promised her anything to get her to talk to police , lubet wrote . `` thus , there is nothing in either the audio recording or the transcript of the interview that demonstrates that defendant understood these two rights and waived them . '' nowak testified at the august hearing she did not respond to becton 's questions because she was confused , lubet wrote . in addition , he said , becton used `` legally impermissible '' statements and techniques , including threats , to get nowak 's statements and consent . `` well , what you say can change what you 're charged with , '' becton said at one point . `` right now we 're looking at -lsb- a -rsb- possible life felony of carjacking . '' in a written statement , an orlando police department spokeswoman said it was inappropriate for the department to comment on the case since it is pending in court , and referred questions to prosecutors . lubet noted that , although nowak was given the opportunity to use the restroom and was asked if she wanted something to eat , she was `` subjected to a barrage of questions '' beginning in the predawn hours and was questioned for six hours without being given the opportunity to sleep or make a phone call . `` defendant had not slept during the preceding 24 hours , '' the judge said . nowak 's consent to search her car , lubet wrote , `` followed illegal police activity , such as a prolonged detention , threats to obtain a warrant and repeated requests for consent . '' prosecutors accuse nowak of driving nearly 900 miles from houston to orlando -- wearing nasa diapers to cut down on the number of stops she needed to make -- and donning a disguise before following shipman from baggage claim to a parking lot . her attorney has strongly denied that she wore the diapers . shipman told police that after she got into her car , nowak feigned distress and knocked on the window . when shipman cracked it to talk to her , nowak sprayed her in the face with pepper spray , shipman said . police said nowak was detained as she was disposing of her disguise in an airport trash bin . nowak has said she merely went to the airport to talk to shipman , who had begun dating nowak 's former love interest , navy cmdr. bill oefelein , who was also an astronaut but has since left the astronaut corps . at the august hearing , becton testified that when he searched nowak 's car , he found maps showing how to reach the airport , maps of the airport 's layout , a buck knife and papers including a letter nowak appeared to have written to oefelein 's mother . he also testified he found used and clean diapers in the car . police previously said they also found a bb gun , a steel mallet , a 4-inch knife and rubber tubing in the vehicle . nowak 's attorneys in august filed a notice of intent to rely on an insanity defense , saying in court documents her diagnoses include a litany of more than a dozen psychiatric disorders . on august 30 , lubet granted nowak 's attorneys ' request that her electronic tracking ankle bracelet be removed . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's cristy lenz contributed to this report .
227	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- attorneys for a `` high-value '' terror suspect who says he was tortured while being held at secret cia prisons have requested that a judge bar the agency from destroying evidence of the alleged torture . one of 14 `` high-value '' detainees held at guantanamo bay , cuba , alleges he was tortured . the motion , filed by the center for constitutional rights attorneys on behalf of majid khan -- who is being held at guantanamo bay , cuba -- is dated november 29 . that is a week before cia director michael hayden acknowledged the agency destroyed videotapes it made in 2002 of interrogations of al qaeda suspects using newly approved `` alternative '' interrogation techniques . khan -- a native of pakistan who attended high school in baltimore -- was held for more than three years at the secret cia prisons and `` subjected to an aggressive cia detention and interrogation program notable for its elaborate planning and ruthless application of torture , '' attorney gitanjali s. gutierrez claims in the court documents . details of khan 's torture claims are redacted in the filing -- a whole page is blacked out -- but khan 's attorneys say he suffers `` severe physical and psychological trauma from which he is unlikely ever to recover fully '' as a result of his ordeal . asked about khan 's claims , cia spokesman paul gimigliano told cnn , `` cia 's terrorist interrogation effort has always been small , carefully run , lawful and highly productive . fewer than 100 hardened terrorists have gone through the program since it began in 2002 , and of those , less than a third required any special methods of questioning . the united states does not conduct or condone torture . '' khan 's attorneys claim he was taken into custody in 2003 and `` forcibly disappeared '' before his transfer to guantanamo , `` where he remains imprisoned without charge or trial . '' he filed a legal challenge to his detention in september 2006 and appeared before a combatant status review tribunal in april , the court documents said . he was found to have been properly detained as an enemy combatant , but filed a challenge to that on august 14 . he was not allowed to meet with an attorney , however , until october , the document said . the bush administration contends khan was an operative working for khalid sheikh mohammed , mastermind of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks . khan researched how to blow up gas stations and poison reservoirs in the united states , the administration has said . he is among 14 `` high-value '' detainees held at guantanamo . gutierrez and another ccr attorney , wells dixon , also released declassified notes of their meetings with khan , saying he has been on hunger strikes while in guantanamo , is `` painfully thin and pale '' and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder . in detention , he has been able to communicate with abu zubayda , an alleged lieutenant for osama bin laden , they said in the notes . a government official with knowledge of the destroyed cia tapes has said that zubayda was one of the two al qaeda suspects whose interrogations were videotaped . while undergoing interrogation and torture by the cia , `` khan admitted anything his interrogators demanded of him , regardless of the truth , in order to end his suffering , '' the documents said . without a court order requiring the preservation of evidence , `` there is substantial risk that the torture evidence will disappear '' and that may affect the challenge to his detention , the attorneys claim . the motion was filed in the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit . hayden has said the cia stopped videotaping in 2002 , while khan was not taken into custody until the following year . `` the careful , professional and lawful questioning of hardened terrorists has produced thousands of intelligence reports , revealed exceptionally valuable insights on al qaeda 's operations and organization , foiled terrorist plots and saved innocent lives , '' gimigliano said . `` the information developed by the detention and interrogation program has been irreplaceable , and the program has operated in strict accord with american law .

'' two recent polls by other organizations also show the race statistically even . map : national and state polling . `` one reason the race appears to be tight is that texas democrats are having a hard time choosing between two attractive options , '' says cnn polling director keating holland . `` likely democratic primary voters would be equally happy if either candidate won the nomination , and they do n't see a lot of difference between them on several top issues . `` roughly a quarter of likely voters say they could change their minds in the next two weeks -- and not surprisingly , those people are splitting roughly equally between clinton and obama . '' many political strategists and analysts consider texas and ohio -- which also holds a march 4 primary -- must-win states for clinton . obama has won the past eight contests and is now ahead in the overall battle for delegates , 193 of which are at stake in texas . the new survey indicates arizona sen. john mccain is the clear favorite for the republican presidential nomination . among republicans , 55 percent of likely texas gop primary voters support mccain as their choice for nominee . thirty-two percent back former arkansas gov. mike huckabee and 11 percent support home-state congressman and former libertarian standard-bearer ron paul . the poll 's sampling error for republican respondents is 4 percentage points . the cnn/opinion research corp. poll was conducted by telephone from friday through sunday . pollsters talked to 1,506 adults in texas , including 553 likely republican primary voters and 529 likely democratic primary voters . mccain is the overwhelming front-runner in the fight for the republican presidential nomination and party leaders have rallied around the candidate in an attempt for party unity . the poll was released on the same day the only living former republican president -- george herbert walker bush , the current president 's father -- endorsed mccain at an event in houston . watch mccain get a big boost '' but mccain has had trouble winning conservative voters . just last week , mccain lost the conservative vote to huckabee in the virginia primary , according to exit polls . the new survey , though , suggests mccain may have better luck in texas . `` it looks like mccain has made some inroads with conservative republicans , '' holland said . `` mccain is picking up a bare majority among conservative likely voters in the gop primary . the mccain campaign probably wishes that number were higher , but it does mean that a mccain victory in texas would not be based on the votes of moderates and independents , as has happened in several states in the past few weeks . '' texas democrats and republicans may not see eye to eye on the issues , but the poll suggests they do agree on what 's the most important issue . thirty-five percent of democrats and an equal number of republicans said the economy was the most important issue in their choice for president . the second most important issue for democrats was health care , at 23 percent , followed by the war in iraq at 22 percent , illegal immigration at 10 percent and terrorism at 7 percent . nineteen percent of republicans said illegal immigration was their most important issue , putting it in second place , followed by the war in iraq and terrorism at 17 percent and health care at 8 percent . sixty percent of republicans say they 'll definitely support the candidate they are now backing . that number climbs to 76 percent for democrats . likely democratic primary voters view clinton and obama on roughly equal terms . seventy-nine percent say they would be satisfied if clinton were the nominee ; an equal number feel the same way about obama . seventy-nine percent say it 's likely clinton can win the nomination ; 82 percent say the same about obama . the two candidates are essentially tied on immigration , iraq and the economy , but clinton has an advantage on health care and abortion . e-mail to a friend .

'' the zoo confirmed earlier this week that its other female polar bear , vilma , had eaten her two offspring . the zoo said it feared vera would do the same , so it took her cub away as a precaution . since then , the cub is thriving in the care of humans , but vera seems to miss her cub , foghammar said . watch how zoo has faced criticism over polar bears . '' `` the mother is a little bit nervous , '' she said . `` she walks around and is searching for the baby , but the responsible persons for the zoo say this is normal . it will continue for three or four days . it 's a normal situation .

233	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- before dying , 2-year-old riley ann sawyers was beaten with belts , picked up by her hair , thrown across the room and held under water , according to an affidavit from the galveston county sheriff 's office . police believe 2-year-old riley ann sawyers is `` baby grace . '' the affidavit says the girl 's mother , kimberly dawn trenor , described to police how her daughter died and was put in a plastic storage box that trenor and her husband , royce zeigler , later dumped into a galveston waterway . trenor told police zeigler tried to commit suicide the weekend before thanksgiving , and wrote a note that said , `` my wife is innocent of the sins that i committed . '' the body of the then-unidentified toddler was found on october 29 . a fisherman found riley 's body stuffed inside a blue storage container that washed up on an uninhabited island in galveston 's west bay . a medical examiner said the child 's skull was fractured , and a forensic dentist estimated her age at 2 to 3 years . police dubbed the child `` baby grace . '' a police artist 's sketch of her was widely circulated in the news media and prompted a call to galveston police from riley 's grandmother in ohio , who had not seen the girl in months . on saturday , police arrested trenor and zeigler on charges of injuring a child and tampering with physical evidence , the sheriff 's department said . their bonds were set at $ 350,000 each . the affidavit , obtained by cnn , says when police interviewed trenor on november 23 , she `` gave a voluntary statement on video with her attorney present in which she describes her involvement , with royce zeigler , in the physical abuse , death and disposal of the remains of her daughter , riley ann sawyers . '' trenor 's statement said on july 24 , she and zeigler both beat the child with leather belts and held her head under water in the bathtub . she said zeigler picked the girl up by her hair and also threw her across the room , slamming her head into the tile floor . after her daughter died , trenor 's statement said , she and zeigler went to a wal-mart that night and bought the sterilite container , a shovel , concrete mix , and other supplies . the statement said the box containing the child 's body was hidden in a storage shed for `` one to two months . '' then , trenor said , she and zeigler carried it to the galveston causeway and tossed it in , and she saw it drifting away . riley ann 's father , robert sawyers , on monday tearfully remembered her as a `` fun-loving girl ... with a big imagination . '' watch riley ann 's father describe the little girl '' riley was `` very active , very hyper , but also very well-behaved , '' sawyers told reporters in mentor , ohio . she would play `` with a water hose ... spraying the whole patio soaking wet until she was done with it , '' he said , as he sat behind two photographs of his daughter , a toddler with wispy blond curls . robert sawyers ' mother , sheryl sawyers , said the family was `` devastated '' to learn that police believe riley is dead . `` it 's hard to think that i 'll never see her again , '' she said , clutching a red elmo doll she had planned to give riley for christmas . maj. ray tuttoilmondo of the galveston county sheriff 's department said monday that authorities are `` fairly confident '' that the toddler whose body was found on october 29 is riley ann sawyers . dna analysis is still in progress to confirm the identification . the results will be available in two to three weeks , tuttoilmondo said . tuttoilmondo said riley is originally from mentor , ohio , a cleveland suburb , and that `` she and her mother came down to texas earlier this year . '' the toddler was last seen in texas `` three or four months ago , '' tuttoilmondo said , although he did not know by whom . tuttoilmondo said police did investigate whether child protective services had taken riley away , something the mother had reportedly alleged . of that report , tuttoilmondo said , `` what we believe is that is not what happened . '' the affidavit said trenor admitted that after the body was found , zeigler had her type up a fake letter from the ohio department of children 's services saying that riley was to be taken away . trenor left ohio in late may , after filing an allegation of domestic violence against robert sawyers and reaching a joint voluntary agreement that gave her custody of riley and gave robert sawyers visitation rights , the sawyers ' family lawyer said monday . `` she disappeared , '' laura depledge said monday at the ohio news conference with the sawyers . sheryl sawyers said monday that she saw widely distributed police sketches of `` baby grace '' and contacted galveston police in november . the girl in the police sketches strongly resembles photos of riley . `` no , i never did think it would end up like this , '' sheryl sawyers said monday , eyes welling . `` i guess knowing is better than not knowing . '' the girl 's family in ohio has been `` very helpful '' in this case , tuttoilmondo said , adding that the fbi and a galveston county police officer visited the family in ohio on sunday . depledge said riley was the product of a `` teenage pregnancy . '' trenor and robert sawyers were together for two years as a result of the pregnancy , depledge said , during which time they lived with sheryl sawyers . depledge said monday that the family , whose grief she described as `` simply overwhelming , '' wants riley 's body returned to ohio for a memorial service . `` what riley needs is to be brought home , '' she said . `` i think this family needs some closure . '' tuttoilmondo asked anyone who knew the child or her family to help detectives reconstruct the events of riley 's short life . the toddler 's case has touched even hardened police officers , he said . `` any way you look at it , we carry a piece of her with us , and we 'll always carry a little piece of her with us , '' he said monday . he held up a small , pink-and-white shoe identical to those the child was wearing when she was found . `` that says it all . a little-bitty shoe .

'' the plaintiffs are asking for $ 10 million in compensatory damages and $ 10 million in punitive damages for each of the 393 victims named in the suit . earlier this year , chiquita , as part of a plea agreement , admitted that what it called protection payments had been given to autodefensas unidas de colombia , or auc . auc was named a terrorist organization by the united states in 2002 , making it a crime to give them money . the lawsuit alleges chiquita 's interaction with the paramilitary group went further than the payments -- it accuses the company of facilitating shipments of arms to the group . `` they conspired with the auc , aided and abetted them in a far-reaching conspiracy and plan to control every aspect of banana growing , distribution and sale , '' reiter said . the attorney said one couple refused to sell their banana farm `` for pennies '' and were killed by auc in 2001 , and other murder victims had been directed to `` sell their bananas only to chiquita . '' the families filing the suit will remain anonymous because of fear of reprisals in their home country , he said . `` the principle upon which this lawsuit is brought is that when you put money into the hands of terrorists , when you put guns into the hands of terrorists , then you are legally responsible for the atrocities , the murders and the tortures that those terrorists commit , '' reiter said . responding to the allegations wednesday afternoon , the company said , `` chiquita brands international categorically denies the allegations made by these attorneys . we reiterate that chiquita and its employees were victims and that the actions taken by the company were always motivated to protect the lives of our employees and their families .

'' mitchell said the company will fight the allegations . `` chiquita has already been the victim of extortion in colombia . we will not allow ourselves to become extortion victims in the united states . '' in the march plea agreement , chiquita brands international agreed to pay a $ 25 million fine for the payments made by the company 's former banana-producing subsidiary in colombia . during a government investigation , the company admitted to making payments to auc even after outside counsel told the company those payments were illegal and should stop immediately . e-mail to a friend .

244	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- despite the obvious claims of younger rivals cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi , few can really argue with the 96 football journalists who voted ricardo izecson dos santos leite as the 2007 world footballer of the year . brazilian genius kaka fully deserves winning the 2007 world footballer of the year award . the prestigious ballon d'or award is widely regarded as the most prestigious individual prize in football and kaka 's inclusion on its coveted roll of honor is a testament to the 25-year-old brazilian 's current standing in world football . when ac milan defeated liverpool in the champions league final in athens , avenging their heartbreaking loss to the same team in istanbul two years previously , it enabled kaka to fulfill his dream of holding aloft europe 's premier trophy -- a winner 's medal he fully deserved after a sublime 90-minute performance . kaka 's stock for both club and country has risen steadily since his move to the san siro from sao paulo for a fee of just $ 8.5 million in the summer of 2003 . unlike many a brazilian sporting genius , kaka did not hone his skills on the beach or the streets of a favela shanty town . he was born into a comfortable middle class brasilia family , where football was not the only hope of a bright future . however , it soon became clear that this particular boy had a very special skill and he was signed by sao paulo , after his family had moved there , at just eight years of age -- making his first team debut as an 18-year-old . kaka 's progress was soon picked up by his national team coach and felipe scolari named the graceful midfielder in his 23-man squad for the 2002 world cup finals , earning him a winners ' medal despite playing only 19 minutes of the tournament in a group match against costa rica . a year later , and kaka was on his way to milan . within a month he had made the starting line-up and his 10 goals helped the rossoneri lift the scudetto and the european super cup . throughout his career , kaka has always possessed the innate ability to score goals -- his record for both club and country sees him average roughly a goal every three games . yet to describe kaka merely as a goalscoring midfielder would be doing him a massive injustice . tall , elegant and blessed with astonishing skill , milan and brazil utilize kaka 's ability superbly . milan coach carlo ancelotti soon recognized kaka 's genius , changing his team 's system to a 4-4-1-1 , playing the brazilian behind a main target man . with andrea pirlo and gennaro gattuso holding the central midfield area , kaka has a license to roam in behind the lone striker , be it filippo inzaghi , ronaldo or alberto gilardino . and kaka does this with devastating effect , running at the opposition with pace and power , finding defense-splitting passes or shooting from range with deadly accuracy be it from a dead-ball situation or open play . the fly in the ointment for milan comes in the shape of their poor form this season . although they have already reached the last 16 of the champions league , the club are floundering in serie a and face the unthinkable prospect of not qualifying for next season 's competition unless they win the trophy . real madrid have coveted kaka for the last two years -- expect the world transfer record to be smashed if milan do n't secure a place among europe 's elite . e-mail to a friend .

'' but former tennessee sen. fred thompson said calling for musharraf to step down would n't be a good idea . `` i hope that we as candidates out here do n't start lobbying these ideas that get plenty of attention but are not very sound , '' thompson told cnn . former north carolina sen. john edwards said he called musharraf and `` urged him to continue this democratization process . '' democratic hopeful joe biden , chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , said bhutto 's death was a `` genuine tragedy .
