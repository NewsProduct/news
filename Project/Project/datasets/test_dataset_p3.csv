501	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- he 's been described as the richard branson of asian airlines . and he certainly knows a thing or two about building a brand . tony fernandes , ceo of air asia , spoke to cnn 's andrew stevens in the boardroom . in just five years , tony fernandes has built air asia from a bankrupt local carrier to the region 's biggest budget airline -- 18 million passengers will fly the airline this year . cnn 's andrew stevens talked to fernandes in macau to find out why , at the age of 37 , he would leave a comfortable job in the music industry to start a new business in the cut-throat , not to mention high risk , aviation industry . fernandes : well there 's a fine line between brilliance and stupidity , so the second point in a statement that richard branson 's made is how to become a millionaire , start with a billion and start an airline . now i was the other way around , i did n't have a billion . so i think that was one of the things , that i did n't have a lot to lose . and i thought i was young enough . i got tired of the corporate life , i got tired of corporate politics . and i saw a business opportunity . everyone likes to fly . and i think the key number that got me going was only six percent of malaysians flew . i started looking at the prices of tickets , and to travel from one part of malaysia to another it was almost someone 's one month salary . so that drove me . but i did n't want to be there , you know , at 55 , and say i should 've done it . life is about risks , life is about not being afraid to fail . stevens : but at the time , airlines were going into bankruptcy , oil prices were going through the roof , people were too scared to fly globally , did n't you think , `` oh my god i 've made the worse decision of my life ? '' fernandes : no , i knew malaysians very well . you put a price low enough , they 'd risk their lives . i think also when you start a business the most important thing is does the market want it . and i knew the market wanted it . if that 's there , everything is surmountable because people power is strong . stevens : you like to pluck people from all different walks of life , from all different professions . how do you meld them all together ? what 's the philosophy underlying this ? fernandes : well i think , first is that everyone plays a part . there is no hierarchy . everyone is valuable . i make all my senior management carry bags and things so they appreciate that . stevens : do they ? fernandes : oh yes , they do . some try to shirk their duties , but it 's very hard when they see the ceo doing it -- they have to do it . the second is that everyone 's got ability , it 's how you bring the best out of them . and that 's a very motivating thing . if you see someone who 's carrying a bag suddenly flying a plane . that 's a very powerful motivator . you can do all the theory and books and promise people the world but when they see it in reality , boy that 's a powerful thing to see . stevens : when air asia started , you were known to go down , roll up your sleeves , and really get in with your staff at all levels , do you still have time to do that ? fernandes : i have less time , but i still do it . i think it 's fundamental to running my company , because , unless you get down to the floor and see what 's happening , you wo n't make effective decisions . i do it for two reasons . one is , to see what 's going on , and to make sure if i 'm making the right decisions . and the second thing is , i still want to discover these raw diamonds . stevens : what 's the best piece of business advice you 've ever been given ? fernandes : focus and discipline . stay focused and disciplined . stick to a plan , stick to a vision . you change but the vision 's still the same . and that came from conor mccarthy of ryanair . he has taught me about discipline and focus and i think that 's been a really good lesson for me . e-mail to a friend .
502	bogota , colombia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the commander of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia 's force 47 told reporters in bogota monday -- a day after surrendering -- that `` the solution is not through war . there must be dialogue . '' nelly avila moreno , center , alias karina , is escorted by soldiers after surrendering . nelly avila moreno , 45 , whose nom de guerre was karina , said she and her longtime male companion made the decision jointly to abandon the farc group , based in the jungle , at 5 a.m. sunday . she said pressure from colombian soldiers had been key to their decision , and she called on her fellow rebels to follow her example . `` i invite them to change the sensibility that is among the guerrillas , '' she said , seated by her companion , who said nothing during the news conference . she also had a message for the colombian people : `` it is important to do something for peace in colombia , and that need to do something is precisely one of my motivations . '' after 24 years with the farc , karina said she wants to reintegrate with society . `` at this moment , what i am thinking about is reuniting with my family and with all of society , '' she said . karina said she had had no contact with the group 's leaders for the past two years . during that time , she said , `` i was trying to stay alive . '' she said she knows nothing about the group 's leaders , because `` everything in the farc is very compartmentalized . '' still , she did hear through the news media about the killing by another member of farc of ivan rios , a member of the group 's central high command . `` we suffered a very strong blow , '' she said . she acknowledged that news led her to worry about the possibility that one of her fellow guerrillas might consider doing the same thing to her . `` a person has a lot of combatants alongside , but you do n't know what each one is thinking , '' she said . asked about news reports of guerrilla operations she may have participated in , karina admitted to nothing . `` they accuse me of a lot of things i was n't part of , '' she said . but miguel antonio paez told cnn en espanol that he remembers well the woman who , with a band of guerrillas , stopped the bus he was on in 2004 in northwest colombia , ordered him and the other passengers off and the bus be burned . `` the commander of that guerrilla group -- a dark-haired woman , tall , with one eye missing -- called herself karina , '' he said . `` she ordered me tied up . here , i have the marks from the wires , and there , while i was tied up , she lopped off my penis and testicles and i remained castrated for all my life . '' asked specifically about the killing of the father of president alvaro uribe in 1983 , she said she did not know who carried out the act , and added , `` i do n't have my hands stained in that deed . '' she said that with her surrender have come new fears about possible retribution from farc loyalists , who consider her a traitor . wearing a red sweatshirt and what appeared to be a diamond earring in her left ear , she said she once believed the farc would rule colombia . `` i once dreamed of that , '' she said . gen. mario montoya , chief of the army , said two colombian air force helicopters were sent sunday to pick up karina and her companion , who had given authorities their general location . `` with this , we have given a confounding strike to the farc structure , '' particularly to front 47 , which at this point is practically dismantled , '' he said . since the killing of rios , 45 members of the group have laid down their arms and accepted a government plan for reinstallation into society , he said . `` we want to send a message to all members of farc who persist in the mountains , '' he said . `` to tell them , what karina has done is the road all the members of farc should go down . if they do n't , we are going to continue combating them . today , more than ever , i invite them to lay down their arms , take the plan . we do n't want them dead . we want them alive .

503	-lrb- gametap.com -rrb- -- everyone wants to be more physically fit , but the toughest thing is finding motivation -- the motivation to get started , the motivation to keep going , the motivation to push yourself to the next level . a man tries out the wii fit at a nintendo launch party in central park , new york city . wii fit does n't try to motivate you with before and after photos . it does n't try to motivate you with testimonials from fitness gurus . it does n't even offer you three easy payments . but it does entice you to get into shape by making working out look like fun . and that it does very well . in fact , wii fit might be some of the most fun you can have by just more or less standing still , which must make it about as mass market friendly as any video game product ever was . wii fit requires a wii , of course , and it comes bundled with a balance board . but the entire setup does n't take up much space , and the board is no eyesore , either . unlike a bathroom scale that 's usually squirreled away in a closet or shoved into the corner of a bathroom , looking at it does n't make you feel guilty . designed to fit in with japanese living rooms , where space is usually at a premium , the balance board is sleek and elegantly designed . ireport.com : send us your wii fit review . it conveys cool asian style with a streamlined appearance . it 's something you would n't mind having in your living room at all . one thing about nintendo : they know how to make hardware that 's rugged but easy on the eyes . getting started with wii fit is a snap , but you might have to get some bad news out of the way first . the balance board connects to the wii through a wi-fi connection . you stand on it and use the wii remote to record your height and age . the balance board then registers your weight . from those figures , wii fit calculates your body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- , a standard metric many doctors use to determine a person 's overall fitness , which you can track over time . oddly , however , there 's no easy way to just use the scale to see your weight without recalculating your bmi each time . the wii fit-ness program is organized into 48 activities divided among four general areas : yoga , aerobics , strength training , and balance games . you can choose to work through all four in one session or just concentrate on one . if you 've never tried yoga before , working through the 15 positions here are as good an introduction as any . all of them are done with at least one foot on the balance board , so wii fit can measure how centered you keep your body . yoga is a great way to stretch muscles and joints out and to work on overall flexibility . as meditative as this physical activity would seem , you 'll feel the burn even before you reach any of the advanced forms . once you 're loosened up a little with yoga , you might move on to aerobics . the majority of these nine activities are basically variations of hula hooping , jogging in place , and simple step aerobics . the one exception is rhythm boxing , which you unlock later on . by turning these aerobic challenges all into minigames , wii fit entices you to keep working on them to earn better scores and ratings . with the hula hoop , for example , you have to stand on the board and grind your hips to keep a virtual hoop twirling . later , you have to `` catch '' tossed hoops , and then keep them all twirling , too . wii fit sets a mellow , steady pace for all its aerobic challenges , but it still manages to make your heart pump . if just the words `` push '' and `` ups '' makes you break out in a sweat , then you 've probably already surmised that strength training contains some of the most physically demanding wii fit workouts . the torso twist and rowing squat are easy , but push-ups , planks , and even the lunges will show you what you 're made of . the push-ups in particular make you work extra hard . you do push-ups with your two hands on the board , but because it 's 17 1/2 inches wide , people over six feet tall or with broad shoulders might find themselves with their hands positioned inside their shoulder width . while it 's certainly a worthwhile goal to build up to , it 's difficult to snap off a set of push-ups from that position . the balance games require you to just apply pressure to the board through your feet . skiing slaloms and ski jumping are fairly straightforward , but you can also walk a tightrope or try to float down a river inside a giant bubble . all of these are simple and fun , and they really do make you aware of how well you maintain good posture and keep your balance . however , they are also short and very limited in the variety of levels and layouts . could you do all these exercises and balance activities right now without wii fit ? sure you could . but would you ? that 's where the wii fit balance board comes in . just like the wii itself , it just looks like something you 'd like to try out . but once you take that first step onto it , you might find yourself on the way to becoming more fit . read about video games . watch video game news . play complete , original console , arcade and pc games - free ! visit gametap.com . copyright : tm & © 2007 turner broadcasting system , inc. . a time warner company , or its licensors . patent pending . all rights reserved . gametap is part of the turner young adult network .
504	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- cristiano ronaldo missed an early penalty as manchester united earned a 0-0 draw in the first leg of the champions league semifinal at barcelona 's nou camp stadium on wednesday night . cristiano ronaldo sent his penalty attempt wide as united failed to take an early lead at the nou camp . the portugal winger , the top scorer in this season 's competition , spurned the chance to net for the 39th time overall this campaign and give united a vital away goal . the 23-year-old hit the stanchion high outside goalkeeper victor valdes ' left-hand post in the third minute after gabriel milito handled his header from a paul scholes corner . it was united 's best chance in a game dominated by the home side , who had the best of possession with some silky moves but failed to find the killer pass in the final third of the pitch . united goalkeeper edwin van der sar made a string of saves , especially in the second half , but was not often seriously tested . barcelona were boosted by the return of argentina forward lionel messi , who started alongside samuel eto'o up front , with thierry henry on the bench after also being cleared following an illness . messi picked out samuel eto'o in the 13th minute only for midfielder scholes -- making his 100th champions league appearance -- to make a vital interception . barcelona pressed forward again in the 21st minute and rafael marquez got clear of his marker but his header failed to trouble van der sar , who was back in the side following a groin injury . then yaya toure showed good skill for the home side and sent a good cross into the area that was turned away by van der sar . ronaldo felt he should have had another penalty in the 30th minute when he was bundled over by marquez after xavi had carelessly lost possession , but swiss referee massimo busacca allowed play to continue . eto'o rattled in a shot after 34 minutes but wes brown -- who passed a late fitness test to replace the ill nemanja vidic in central defense -- made a vital block . brown partnered rio ferdinand , with england midfielder owen hargreaves operating as a makeshift right-back . deco , starting his first game for barcelona after two months out with injuries , then failed to test van der sar with a free-kick in the 38th minute . marquez was booked in the 44th minute after tripping ronaldo as he attempted to surge forward , meaning the mexican is suspended for next tuesday 's second leg at old trafford . ronaldo sent his effort from an acute angle wide of the post . after the break , messi saw his effort blocked in the 47th minute and then van der sar tipped over defender gianluca zambrotta 's long-range effort . messi beat three united players but ferdinand cut out his low cross from the right , then he played in a superb ball for eto'o -- who lashed his shot against the side-netting . deco tested van der sar with a low drive , then the dutchman easily dealt with a 20-yard effort from xavi . barcelona coach frank rijkaard took off messi in the 62nd minute , replacing him with teenager bojan krkic , who scored the winner in the first leg of the quarterfinal against schalke . a foul on the serbian-born spaniard drew a yellow card for hargreaves in the 73rd minute , then united boss alex ferguson bolstered his midfield by bringing on nani for england forward wayne rooney -- who had started up front with carlos tevez . rijkaard responded by replacing deco with henry in the 77th minute , and the french forward forced a scrambled save by van der sar with a long-range shot on 83 . ferguson brought on veteran winger ryan giggs for tevez soon after , then van der sar denied andres iniesta and also dived to comfortably save henry 's free-kick from 35 yards . barcelona continued to press until the final whistle , but still could not create a clear-cut opportunity . e-mail to a friend .

'' it was intended to prevent large crowds from gathering at the blast site and hampering the investigation , said jaipur police director kanhaiya lal . also , tempers could flare as mourners spend the day carrying bodies to their home villages and to crematoriums , he said . home ministry officials suspect the islamic militant group harkat-ul-jihad al-islami -lrb- huji -rrb- of being behind the attacks , according to cnn 's sister network cnn-ibn and the press trust of india . no one has claimed responsibility . in the past , officials have blamed attacks within its borders on `` foreign '' islamic extremist groups fighting against indian rule in the disputed himalayan territory of kashmir . it is a term that is commonly understood to refer to pakistan . kashmir has been the source of bitter dispute and two wars between india and pakistan . both control parts of the region , which is predominantly muslim . pakistan has denied any involvement in the attacks . see the aftermath of the explosions . '' raje told reporters wednesday that the military had been placed on alert and security tightened around the borders of the state , the western edge of which lies next to pakistan . she also took to task the central government , saying it had provided no advance warning about the possibility of such an attack . furthermore , raje said , the central government left a state-proposed organized crime bill unapproved for two years . the bill would have allowed local police more leeway to interrogate suspects plotting attacks , she said . on tuesday evening , eight bombs tore through crowded markets and a packed hindu temple in jaipur 's walled city . the blasts went off within a 12-minute span and within 500 meters -lrb- 0.3 miles -rrb- of each other . police defused a ninth bomb . the jaipur blasts bear an eerie resemblance in its pattern to a deadly attack two years ago in india 's financial capital , mumbai . in july 2006 , more than 200 people were killed when seven explosions targeted commuter trains in mumbai , formerly bombay . in that incident , the explosions went off within a span of 11 minutes . both attacks used rdx , one of the most powerful kinds of military explosives , and ammonium nitrate , an oxidizing agent in explosives . and both attacks took place during the evening hours and on tuesdays . the jaipur blasts occurred near the temple on a day when devotees pray to hanuman , the hindu monkey king . nearby markets and bazaars that were also targeted were filled with tourists and locals . in the mumbai attack , the blasts were timed to go off during the height of rush hour . and authorities said the bombs all appeared to have been planted on trains that left the churchgate station -- used daily by thousands of commuters in the metropolis of more than 11 million people . indian officials blamed pakistan 's intelligence services and a pakistan-based militant group , lashkar-e-tayyiba , for the attack . pakistan , which banned lashkar-e-tayyiba in 2002 , denied any involvement . the jaipur blast has one more element in common with yet another deadly attack : the use of bicycles . just as on tuesday , assailants used bombs strapped to bicycles in an attack at a mosque in the western indian city of malegaon in september 2006 . at least 33 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in that explosion , which took place on a friday -- when the mosque is filled with muslim worshippers . that attack was also blamed lashkar-e-tayyiba . authorities have not connected the jaipur blast to any previous attacks . huji -- or the movement of islamic holy war -- is considered a terrorist organization by the united states . it is banned in neighboring bangladesh , where it is accused of carrying out several attacks , including a foiled plot to kill the country 's former prime minister sheikh hasina in 2000 . and it has been blamed for several attacks inside india , including one at the american center in calcutta that killed five policemen in 2002 . india ranks among the countries where terrorism is most common , the u.s. state department said . `` the conflict in jammu and kashmir , attacks by extreme leftist naxalites and maoists in eastern and central india , assaults by ethno-linguistic nationalists in the northeastern states , and terrorist strikes nationwide by islamic extremists took more than 2,300 lives this year , '' the agency said . cnn 's tess eastment and saeed ahmed contributed to this report .

508	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- al qaeda is still operating within pakistan 's mountainous tribal region bordering afghanistan , and the united states lacks a `` comprehensive '' plan for meeting its national security goals there , said a u.s. government study released thursday . a pakistani policeman watches over a border area in february 2008 . despite the united states providing $ 10.5 billion in military and economic aid to pakistan , a key u.s. ally , the government accountability office said it `` found broad agreement ... that al qaeda had regenerated its ability to attack the united states and had succeeded in establishing a safe haven '' in pakistan 's federally administrated tribal areas . of the $ 10.5 billion in u.s. aid , more than half -- $ 5.8 billion -- was specifically provided for the tribal region , the gao said . furthermore , the report said , `` no comprehensive plan for meeting u.s. national security goals in fata has been developed , as stipulated by the national security strategy for combating terrorism -lsb- in 2003 -rsb- , called for by an independent commission -lsb- in 2004 -rsb- and mandated by congressional legislation -lsb- in 2007 -rsb- . '' `` our report does not state that the u.s. lacks agency-specific plans ; rather , we found that there was no comprehensive plan that integrated the combined capabilities of defense , state , usaid -lsb- u.s. agency for international development -rsb- , the intelligence community , '' gao said . after the september 11 terrorist attacks , u.s. officials said intelligence indicated that osama bin laden and other senior al qaeda leaders , who had been based in afghanistan before the attacks on new york and washington , were operating in the tribal region . pakistani president pervez musharraf has denied that claim and has said that u.s. military missions there would violate pakistan 's sovereignty . so , since 2002 , the united states has `` relied principally on the pakistan military to address u.s. national security goals '' in that region , the gao report said . of the $ 5.8 billion the united states provided for aid in the tribal region , 96 percent of it reimbursed pakistan for military operations there , the agency said . two of the eight lawmakers who commissioned the gao report , democratic sens. tom harkin of iowa and bob menendez of new jersey , said it indicated a failing on the part of the bush administration . `` the bush administration has had six years to come up with a plan to get osama bin laden and his group , but it is still flying by the seat of its pants , '' menendez said in a statement . `` we 've dumped 10 billion american taxpayer dollars into pakistan with the expectation that the terrorists will be hunted down and smoked out , but al qaeda has been allowed to rejuvenate in the area that is supposed to be locked down , '' he said . harkin called the report 's findings `` appalling . '' `` the white house must propose a strategic policy in this area and follow it , especially when we have this new opportunity to forge a fresh strategic relationship with the new civilian government in pakistan , '' he said in a statement . the defense department said it agreed with the report 's findings , according to letters attached at the end of the gao report , but the state department disagreed with them , saying there was a comprehensive plan in place . a letter from kathleen turner , a spokeswoman for the office of the director of national intelligence , said that office and the national counterterrorism center concurred with the report 's assessment that the united states has not met its national security goals in the tribal region but maintained that there was a plan in place . usaid said that it generally agreed with the report 's recommendation for a comprehensive plan but that work in the tribal areas should be guided by the pakistani government 's own fata sustainable development plan from 2006 . e-mail to a friend .

'' terrill is chasing out unsavory-looking characters from a street corner that resembles a drug dealer 's dream at night . more than 20 suspicious people were seen huddling in the dark in the front driveway and side parking lot on this night . some were seen openly making drug deals . watch `` bum-bot '' in action '' but during the day , it 's where young children frolic on a nearby playground at a the beacon of light daycare center in downtown atlanta . it has become a nightmare for day care operator lydia meredith . `` this whole square is enveloped with homeless people and drug dealers , defecating , urinating , prostituting -- the whole nine yards . and the overflow of that behavior , we get to cleanup every morning , '' she says . meredith says people often toss used syringes and condoms onto the playground . terrill , an engineer by trade , is also a board member at the day care center . tired of cleaning up after the shady characters , he decided to take action . that 's when he built his downtown darth vader of sorts . `` he 's a neighborhood vigilante , '' says meredith , `` and when he came up with this -- you know , i call it robocop -- i said , ` praise god . ' '' the daycare center is a block from a homeless shelter . meredith has a security guard at the center who leaves in the early evening . `` they know when the guard leaves , '' she says . `` they know when the cleaning crew leaves and then here comes the drug dealers to prey on the homeless people . '' anita beatty , the director of the shelter , is suspicious of the barbecue-smoker robot . `` i just think the whole ` robocop ' spraying people is a little freaky . we really need some police protection in this neighborhood . i think it 's confusing the issue . i think the issue is homeless people . they are being confused with the folks who prey on them and sell them drugs , '' she says . atlanta police patrol the area , but say it 's difficult to stay on top of the large number of people who roam the streets in the area late at night . police major lane hagin says the robot is definitely a different crime-fighting idea . `` there 's no problem with the robot going up and down the street or being visible or any of the other things it does -- with the exception of spraying water on people . '' hagin adds , `` then , it becomes an assault no matter where it happens . '' so far no one has filed charges against terrill or the robot . but one homeless man who declined to give his name followed terrill and his robot down the street and laughingly told him , `` i know about you . i can sue you for assault . '' terrill says he 's not hurting anyone and often sprays the water to the side of loiterers as a ploy to get them to move on . he 's also not about to back down . `` if you 're throwing condoms out on the side of the playground , if you 're throwing needles , you 're throwing crack pipes out there , i 'm not going to let those kids be out there like that . i 'm going to stop you . '' terrill bought his bar four years ago knowing nothing about the restaurant business . he ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor of georgia in 2006 . he 's had ongoing problems with people breaking into his bar and stealing things , but it was the day care center problems that spurred him on to create the robot . some of terrill 's bar patrons say they 've seen a difference in the neighborhood . susanne coe lives nearby . `` i 've seen a marked change simply with this robot that does n't have any power of arrest . it does scare people and to be honest with you i 'm grateful for it , '' she says . on this night , as terrill and his robot make their way to the street corner , he shines the robot 's spotlight on the parking lot of the daycare center . one by one , the shadowy figures stand up , walk away and saunter down the street . `` ninety-nine percent of the time , when i go up there and once i turn the spotlight on and i talk to them through the speaker , they leave , '' he says . e-mail to a friend .
510	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- before monday , eliot spitzer was a rising star in the democratic party -- his squeaky-clean image as a corruption buster led to his being mentioned as a potential vice-presidential candidate and possibly even a future white house contender . new york gov. eliot spitzer arrives with his wife monday for a press conference . now , after federal investigators have linked the new york governor to a top-dollar prostitution ring , political advisers are split over whether spitzer has any political future at all . `` there 's no way he can survive it , '' said ed rollins , a republican political consultant and adviser to former presidential candidate mike huckabee . `` all the facts are n't out there , but as they 're being reported , there 's no way you can survive . `` not only is he a hypocrite , he may also end up being a charged felon . '' on monday , spitzer publicly apologized for an undisclosed personal matter . he did not specifically mention the prostitution sting , nor did he resign . watch spitzer 's apology '' the apology came four days after federal prosecutors announced the arrests of four people in an international prostitution ring that charged clients up to $ 5,500 an hour . a source with knowledge of the probe said that wiretaps in the case identify spitzer as an unnamed client who met a prostitute on february 13 at a washington hotel . many political professionals said they were stunned by monday 's developments regarding spitzer , a man who once made a name for himself going after organized crime and wall street corruption as new york 's attorney general . `` obviously , the facts are going to come out in the next several days and the story will be told , '' said robert zimmerman , a political adviser and democratic national committee member . `` but if the facts are as we suspect , it 's very hard to imagine him staying in office . '' but james carville , a cnn political analyst and onetime adviser to former president bill clinton , said spitzer could hold on to his position if the scandal remains strictly about sex -- or if it 's revealed that his political enemies were responsible for leaking the story . carville mentioned other high-profile politicians who have weathered sex scandals , including republican sen. larry craig of idaho , who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor after his arrest in a men 's room sex sting , and his own former client , president clinton . `` all of us remember the monica lewinsky scandal and the immediate rush to judgment , '' he said . `` a lot of people said , ` how could bill clinton survive a scandal like that ? ' yet , he managed to survive . `` if it 's not a financial or monetary thing involved , i do n't know .

'' in the wasteland on the outskirts of basra , dotted with rundown homes , the stench of death mixes with the sewage . local residents told the iraqi army that executions often take place in the area , particularly for women , sometimes killed for something as seemingly innocuous as wearing jeans . militias implemented their own laws with abandon , threatening stores for displaying mannequins with bare shoulders or for selling western music . many store owners are still too frightened to speak publicly . but the horrors of militia rule are now surfacing as some residents begin to feel more comfortable speaking out . inside her rundown home , sabriya 's watery eyes peer out from under her robe . she points to the first photo of one of her sons on the wall . `` this one was killed because he was drinking , '' she says . she draws her finger across her neck and gestures at the next photo . `` this one was slaughtered for his car .

'' both clinton , the new york senator and former first lady , and obama , the first-term senator from illinois , called mccain on tuesday night , campaign officials said . obama told mccain he looks forward to running against him in the fall , campaign spokeswoman jennifer psaki said . mccain is slated to go to the white house on wednesday to receive the endorsement of president bush , according to two republican sources . the arizona senator 's campaign -- his second run for the white house -- was largely written off last summer amid outspoken opposition from the party 's conservative base , a major staff shakeup and disappointing fundraising . but the former navy pilot and vietnam prisoner of war rebounded with wins in january 's primaries in new hampshire and south carolina , the state where his first presidential bid foundered . `` there were times , obviously , when my political campaign was not viewed as the most viable in america , as you probably know , '' he told reporters in san antonio earlier tuesday . `` in fact , i was reminded of the words of chairman mao , who said it 's always darkest before it 's totally black . '' mccain 's fortunes also rebounded as u.s. commanders in iraq credited the 2007 launch of a campaign to pacify baghdad and its surrounding provinces with a sharp decline in american and iraqi casualties . the senator had been one of the most outspoken advocates of the shift and has blasted his potential democratic rivals for calling for the withdrawal of u.s. combat troops from the widely unpopular war . `` this is a man with a lot of trials in his life , '' said former education secretary william bennett , a cnn contributor . `` he 's had a lot of downs ; he 's been up , and this is a big up .

'' in 2000 , mccain upset then-texas gov. george w. bush in the new hampshire primary by touting `` straight talk '' and his record as a republican maverick . bush came back in south carolina amid a divisive and bitter campaign that left mccain denouncing leaders of the party 's religious conservative wing as `` agents of intolerance , '' and bush went on to win the presidency . since then , mccain has enraged conservative leaders by opposing bush 's signature tax cuts , co-sponsoring the campaign finance reform law that now bears his name and supporting a controversial white house-backed plan to offer a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants . but their support was spread among a fractured gop field , and their main standard-bearer , former massachusetts gov. mitt romney , quit the race after a disappointing showing in february 's super tuesday primaries . exit polls in texas and ohio found that about three-quarters of republicans would be satisfied with mccain as their nominee , however . those surveys found that the economy was the top issue for gop voters in both states -- and by a wide margin in ohio , which has seen a sharp decline in manufacturing jobs in the past decade . although national security issues are a strong suit for mccain , castellanos said he might need some help if a weakening economy is the central issue in november . `` it 's never been sen. mccain 's strength , '' castellanos said . he said mccain would need to make the case that `` i 'm going to grow this economy ; barack or hillary , they 're going to grow government .

516	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- we all want to live forever . but , chances are , you 'd rather forego a legacy altogether than have your name be synonymous with a goofy flub like a spoonerism or a dim-witted word like `` dunce . '' you can find a saint under tawdry in the dictionary . for the following eponyms , we ask : did these word-inspiring folks really deserve their drag through the linguistic mud ? 1 . dunce . dictionaries do n't play fair , and john duns scotus is proof . the 13th/14th-century thinker , whose writings synthesized christian theology and aristotle 's philosophy , was considerably less dumb than a brick . unfortunately for scotus , subsequent theologians took a dim view of all those who championed his viewpoint . these `` scotists , '' `` dunsmen , '' or `` dunses '' were considered hairsplitting meatheads and , eventually , just `` dunces . '' 2 . -lrb- slipping a -rrb- mickey . when you have to drug somebody against their will -lrb- hey , you got ta do what you got ta do -rrb- , it just would n't sound right to slip 'em a ricardo , a bjorn , or an evelyn . it 's got ta be a mickey . at the turn of the 20th century , mickey finn was a chicago saloon owner in one of the seediest parts of town -- and he fit right in . finn was known for serving `` mickey finn specials , '' which probably included chloral hydrate , a heavy sedative . after targeted customers passed out , finn would haul them into his `` operating room '' and liberate them of all valuables -lrb- including shoes -rrb- . never a host of the year candidate , this mickey seems to have thoroughly earned his legacy , so do n't hesitate to use it the next time you drug and rob your own customers . 3 . spoonerism . reverend william archibald spooner -lrb- 1844 -- 1930 -rrb- was famous for his muddled one-liners . and though it 's hard to know which ones he actually said , lines such as `` i have a half-warmed fish '' and `` yes indeed , the lord is a shoving leopard '' still prove that the sound-switching flub is pretty charming as far as mistakes go . the spoonerism has even been used as a literary technique by poets and fiction writers , giving spooner little reason to roll over -- or otherwise inarticulately protest -- in his grave . 4 . lynch . although several lynches -lrb- not including david -rrb- have been investigated by inquisitive etymologists , virginia native charles lynch -lrb- 1736 -- 1796 -rrb- is most likely the man behind the murderous word . lynch was a patriot , a planter , and a judge . but when he headed a vigilante court to punish tories -lrb- british loyalists -rrb- during the american revolution , he decided to play the roles of jury and executioner , too . lynch has more than earned his besmirched name . in fact , he did half the besmirching himself by egotistically referring to his actions as `` lynch law '' and `` lynching . '' 5 . shrapnel . while battling napoleon 's army , english general henry shrapnel -lrb- 1761 -- 1842 -rrb- noticed that original-flavor cannonballs just were n't massacring enough enemies for his liking . so , to get more shebang for his shilling , he filled the cannonballs with bullets and exploding charges . these `` shrapnel shells , '' or `` shrapnel-barrages , '' were pretty darn effective , and later designs proved even more successful in world war i. shrapnel did n't get much credit for the `` innovation '' during his lifetime , but he ultimately contributed to enough death and misery that he pretty much deserves to be synonymous with a violent , metallic byproduct of combat . 6 . draconian . a lexis-nexis news search shows that folks are still talking about `` draconian policies , '' `` draconian penalties , '' and , most frighteningly , `` draconian sex rules . '' though athenian lawgiver draco is not entirely confirmed to have existed , if he were real , then around 621 b.c.e. , he instituted two time-honored traditions : 1 -rrb- writing laws down and 2 -rrb- making laws that were batcrap-insane . they include ascribing the death penalty to such atrocities as being lazy , whizzing in an alley , and stealing an apple . apparently , he justified his measures with a sort of non-logic along the lines of , `` jaywalkers deserve to die , and i ca n't do anything worse to mass murderers . so what 're you gon na do ? '' 7 . boycott . in a nutshell ? boycott got boycotted . charles cunningham boycott -lrb- 1832 -- 1897 -rrb- was a retired english army captain who claimed his unwanted fame in 1880 when the irish land league decided to punish him for not lowering his rents . this then-new strategy , which was a mere paragraph in the russian-novel-size saga of irish land reform , was a kind of systematic shunning in which boycott was cut off from servants , supplies , mail , and lifestyle free of death threats . he might have been an evil landlord , but if boycott could see just how successful his name became , he 'd probably be a very sad , regretful , evil landlord . 8 . tawdry . the story of st. audrey -lrb- also known as st. etheldreda -rrb- is a classic example of how bad names happen to good people . st. audrey was the daughter of the king of east anglia -lrb- then the norfolk section of anglo-saxon england -rrb- , who lived a monastery-founding , self-abdicating life . but , when she died of the plague in 679 , she was sporting a pretty nasty-looking tumor on her neck , which gossipmongers blamed on her penchant for wearing audacious necklaces in her youth . after her death , silk scarves called `` st. audrey laces '' were sold in her honor at ely 's annual st. audrey 's fair . then the british tendency for dropping letters and syllables took over , and audrey became `` tawdry . '' it was a short trip from there to the dictionary , and tawdry has been synonymous with gaudy ever since . 9 . chauvinism . nicolas chauvin was an early 19th -- century french soldier who was so patriotic and nationalistic , he gave patriotism and nationalism a bad name -- or at least a new name . a slave to the cult of napoleon , chauvin shed his fair share of blood for the emperor . how did napoleon show his appreciation ? by giving chauvin a ceremonial saber , a ribbon , and a pittance of a pension . later , however , french dramatists began basing über-patriotic characters on chauvin , which paved the way for the soldier 's ultimate reward : a dubious spot in the english language . e-mail to a friend . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .

518	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- those battling global warming by promoting biofuels may unintentionally be adding to skyrocketing world food prices , creating what one expert calls `` a silent tsunami '' in developing nations . the rising prices are `` threatening to plunge more than 100 million people on every continent into hunger , '' josette sheeran , executive director of the united nations ' world food program , said on the agency 's web site tuesday . sheeran is one of the experts attending a food summit hosted tuesday by british prime minister gordon brown , aimed at determining ways to boost food supplies and identify deterrents . also attending the meeting are scientists and representatives from the european union and africa . on the web site , sheeran said the increase in food prices is `` a silent tsunami that respects no borders . '' `` the world 's misery index is rising ... as soaring food and fuel prices roll through the lives of the most vulnerable , '' she said friday . the crisis is forcing the organization to look for cuts in aid to some of its recipients , she said . soaring food prices have triggered violence in some developing countries , and biofuels are bearing at least part of the blame . producing fuel from plant crops is supposed to be greener than drilling for oil , and biofuels generally burn cleaner , too . but the global biofuels industry now stands accused of a list of side effects that are said to be damaging lives , especially of the world 's poorest people . `` the drive for more biofuels means more investment is going into those crops , meaning less land and less investment going in for food crops , causing a massive conflict and resulting in rising prices , which is having a huge negative impact , especially on developing countries , '' said clare oxborrow , food campaigner for friends of the earth . see why tortilla makers are blaming biofuel for increasing food prices '' critics also say that in africa , asia and south america , people are being driven from their land and forests are being cleared to make room for the booming biofuel industry . the international food policy research institute says the use of cereals for industrial purposes like making biofuels has risen by a quarter since 2000 . brown said in an article posted on the 10 downing street web site , `` we now know that biofuels intended to promote energy independence and combat climate change are frequently energy-inefficient . `` we need to look closely at the impact on food prices and the environment of different production methods and to ensure we are more selective in our support . if our uk review shows that we need to change our approach , we will also push for change in eu biofuels targets , '' he said . `` we must also do more to explore the links between climate change and food , and particularly their impact on the livelihoods and vulnerability of the very poorest , who are likely to be most affected by climate change . '' the meeting he convened , brown said , is a precursor to the g8 summit of industrial nations , to be held in july , and a special u.n. summit in september . he urged prompt action . `` with one child dying every five seconds from hunger-related causes , the time to act is now , '' brown stressed . the world health organization views hunger as the no. 1 threat to public health around the world , responsible for a third of child deaths and 10 percent of all disease . douglas alexander , britain 's international development secretary , announced tuesday that britain has set aside a 455 million-pound -lsb- $ 900 million -rsb- aid package to address the food crisis . his agency manages britain 's aid to poor countries with the goal of eliminating extreme poverty . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's phil black contributed to this report .
519	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- gasoline prices set a record for the 16th consecutive day wednesday . a gallon of gas cost an average of $ 3.62 , according to aaa , and much more in some markets . shell oil co. . president john hofmeister says a boost in u.s. production would startle the world market . all three presidential candidates have weighed in on the issue , and president bush on tuesday addressed it during a news conference . john hofmeister , president of shell oil co. , the u.s. division of royal dutch shell , addressed rising gasoline prices during an interview wednesday with john roberts on cnn 's `` american morning . '' roberts : what do you say to people who are in this budget crunch of trying to fill up the family car ? hofmeister : i say we need more gas to be produced in this country . i 've been saying that for three years , ever since i took this position -lsb- as president of shell -rsb- . if the u.s. set a goal to produce 2 to 3 million barrels more a day in this country , we would send a shock around the world that would immediately say to the speculators , hey , u.s. is serious . president -lsb- bush -rsb- said something yesterday about this . i did n't hear him , but i think that 's good news . but we should set a specific target . the presidential candidates should be out there on the postings saying let 's increase domestic production by 2 to 3 million barrels a day . that would be something that would put money back into this country , jobs back into this country , and it would bring more supply toward the americans who need it . roberts : the president is advocating more drilling on u.s. territory . is n't it true that globally we 're starting to reach a peak in production and that within maybe a decade or two oil production will begin to decrease ? hofmeister : well , i think there is some argument -lsb- that -rsb- with convenient , easy oil we will peak sometime in the next decade . i think shell sees that coming , but in terms of total oil supply to the world , we 're a long way from reaching peak oil because it does n't take into account unconventional oil . i think the president brings up a good point in that we could , we have the available domestic supplies off the coast of alaska as well as -lsb- the alaska national wildlife refuge -rsb- . shell has won $ 2 billion worth of high bids for the chukchi sea -- that 's a few years off before we could begin production . but let 's remember there 's more than 100 billion barrels of untouched oil and gas in this country that is subject to a 30-year moratorium . now , there 's only one body in this country that can set a 30-year moratorium , and that 's the u.s. government . roberts : sen. hillary clinton wants to slap you with a 50 percent tax on what she calls windfall profit , profit above a certain level . is that a good idea ? hofmeister : look at our revenues and our income for the last quarter . if we had made $ 7.8 million on $ 114 million of revenue , nobody would call that excessive , because that 's 7 1/2 percent . we made $ 7.8 billion profit on $ 114 billion revenue -- same 7 1/2 percent . so to me that is not an excessive number when banks and pharmaceuticals and it companies earn a whole lot more . watch hofmeister defend shell 's profits '' roberts : would it hurt you if she put in place this tax on the windfall profits ? hofmeister : sure it would . it would slow down investment . taxing the oil companies was tried in the '80s . it drove us to do imports , which is exactly the problem we have today . roberts : where is the top of all this ? how high can the price of a barrel of oil go ? how high will the cost of a gallon of gasoline go ? hofmeister : i heard somebody say the other day it 's as long as a piece of string . we do n't know . roberts : the president of opec said $ 200 a barrel . hofmeister : yeah , well , there are some countries out there subsidizing the cost of their energy to their consumers and industries to compete with america -- or against america -- because they think america wo n't solve the problem . roberts : you 're saying you have no idea where the top is . hofmeister : we do n't know . but we should produce more oil in this country . e-mail to a friend .
520	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- austrian investigators monday released more details about the elaborate underground cellar where josef fritzl kept his daughter imprisoned for 24 years , along with three of their children . josef fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children . investigators believe fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978 , shortly after , according to his daughter , he began raping her at age 11 or 12 , said police spokesman franz polzer . the 73-year-old austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year , and simply added the hidden space -- which was not recorded in any building plans -- polzer said . it took fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition , polzer said . investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison , which was blocked by a 500-kilogram -lrb- 1,100-pound -rrb- steel and concrete door that fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance , polzer said . fritzl , who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar , had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison . `` you would have to open up a total of eight doors , and ... -lrb- for the -rrb- last door which would go into this space -lrb- where the family was imprisoned -rrb- , you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus , '' polzer said . `` we will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we have n't discovered yet , and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting . '' fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter , elisabeth , captive in the dungeon under the fritzl home for decades , repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children -- six of whom survived . three of the children were adopted by josef fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep . the story of the family 's imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago , when one of the children still in the dungeon , 19-year-old kerstin fritzl , fell seriously ill with convulsions . the father agreed to take her to a hospital , the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers . dr. albert reiter , who is treating kerstin , said monday that while her condition is still `` grave , '' it `` has improved somewhat . '' `` she has become more stable , but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help , '' reiter said , noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation . elisabeth and her two sons were reunited with her mother , rosemarie , who police say knew nothing about the basement prison . they were also reunited with the three children that josef had taken from elisabeth . the reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic , where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight -- something the two boys had never seen -- according to the clinic 's chief doctor . `` the mother and the smallest child have , in just the last couple of days , increased their sensitivity to light , '' dr. berthold kepplinger said . `` so we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses . '' five-year-old felix is `` getting more and more lively , '' kepplinger said . `` he 's fascinated by everything that he sees around him -- the fresh air , the light , and the food -- all of these things are helping them , '' he said . `` slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal -lrb- shade -rrb- . '' he also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family . kepplinger praised elisabeth for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity . he said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family , and the children make their beds . however , he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in fritzl 's home . he said the mother , elisabeth , takes breaks and naps several times a day . the health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying , kepplinger said . kepplinger said the children , after being confined to a small space their entire lives , are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces . initially the dungeon where fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters . in 1993 , around the time elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child , fritzl decided to add to the dungeon , building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters . on wednesday or thursday , prosecution authorities will attempt to question fritzl -- who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession , state prosecutor gerhard sedlacek said . a warden at the st. poelten jail , where fritzl is being held , told cnn that fritzl appears to be doing well , but he is refusing to go on walks outside the building where he is detained . e-mail to a friend .

525	editor 's note : in our behind the scenes series , cnn correspondents share their experiences in covering news and analyze the stories behind the events . cnn 's senior vatican analyst john l. allen jr. is following the pope during his u.s. trip . pope benedict xvi asked pilgrims in st. peter 's square on sunday to pray for the success of his u.s. trip . new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the official motto of pope benedict xvi 's april 15-20 visit to the united states , the first of his papacy , is `` christ our hope . '' based on the frequency with which papal spokespersons have struck a different note , however , its unofficial motto might well be , `` this is not a political event . '' here 's a typical example from early april : `` the pope is not coming to get mixed up in the local political process , '' said italian archbishop pietro sambi , the pope 's ambassador to america , in an interview with the national catholic reporter . `` his presence is about something more universal and , at the same time , more personal . '' fear that benedict 's visit might be read through the lens of party politics reflects a key fact of electoral life in america : the `` catholic vote '' matters . to take the most obvious example , if a few heavily catholic counties in ohio had gone the other way in 2004 , pundits would today be handicapping the re-election of president john kerry . america 's almost 70 million catholics , representing a quarter of the country 's population , are diverse and divided . they do n't all agree with official church positions , and although catholics were once reliable democrats , today they 're not clearly aligned with either party . that 's a key reason why states with large catholic populations , such as ohio , pennsylvania , wisconsin and florida , are considered crucial battlegrounds . already in the 2008 race , catholics have made themselves felt . on the democratic side , they 're the biggest single reason sen. hillary clinton is still afloat . so far , the more catholic a state , the better clinton has done . with her back to the wall not long ago in ohio and texas , clinton decisively outpolled sen. barack obama among catholic democrats . in ohio , clinton won the catholic vote by a margin of 63 percent to 36 , while in texas it was 62 percent to 38 . clinton is now hoping that catholics will come through for her again in pennsylvania 's april 22 primary . the state 's 3.87 million catholics represent more than 30 percent of the population , and clinton is clinging to a lead despite pennsylvania sen. robert casey 's endorsement of obama . casey is a hero to pro-life catholic democrats , and his backing is apparently helping obama narrow the gap . clinton does better than obama among latinos , who are disproportionately catholic . she 's also winning catholic `` reagan democrats , '' meaning socially conservative blue-collar voters . obama 's recent gaffe , telling a crowd in san francisco , california , that small-town americans were `` clinging to guns or religion '' out of economic frustration , may help cement that advantage . once the democrats settle on a candidate , the catholic vote seems wide open in november . sen. john mccain , the presumptive republican nominee , appeals to many catholics because he 's pro-life and has a moderate stance on immigration . yet his willingness to remain in iraq for `` 100 years '' is at odds with the church 's opposition to the war . either clinton or obama could make a strong appeal to catholics on peace-and-justice issues , yet both are out of sync with catholic teaching on issues such as abortion , stem-cell research and gay rights . both sides are expected to court catholics aggressively . the mccain campaign recently formed a `` national catholics for mccain committee '' led by former kansas sen. sam brownback and former oklahoma gov. frank keating , along with a `` who 's who '' of prominent catholic conservatives . obama has his own `` national catholic advisory council , '' led by casey and former indiana rep. tim roemer , both pro-life democrats . clinton likewise has top-drawer catholic advisers . pope benedict 's trip is unlikely to offer a decisive boost to either side . he 'll probably strike pro-life notes that republicans can exploit , but he 'll also likely accent peace , concern for the poor and the environment , issues that generally skew to the democrats . watch as cnn 's rosemary church speaks with vatican analyst john allen about the pope 's visit '' any political fallout may thus depend on what happens to the pope 's message once it 's swept up into the sausage grinder of american spin . benedict xvi usually speaks not in sound bites but in carefully crafted paragraphs , which sometimes leaves the door ajar for competing explanations of what he really means . one can expect a `` war for the microphone '' among republican and democratic operatives , each looking to exploit pieces of the pope 's message . in a tight race , movement of even a few percentage points among catholics could be decisive . one sign the democrats understand what 's at stake is that house speaker nancy pelosi has arranged an april 16 conference call with reporters to comment on benedict 's trip -- in effect , not wanting president bush , and by extension the republicans , to claim a monopoly on the pope . all this makes the political implications of the pope 's presence difficult to anticipate . the best advice boils down to that classic broadcast cliché : `` stay tuned !

527	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- canada 's house of commons voted thursday to extend the country 's military mission in afghanistan until 2011 , with the stipulation that nato send reinforcements to the volatile kandahar province . canadian soldiers walk along a track at the kandahar air base in afghanistan last month . most of canada 's 2,500 troops in afghanistan are in kandahar as part of the nato-led mission to stabilize the war-torn country . their presence has sparked controversy in canada , with the bloc quebecois and the new democratic party calling for an immediate troop withdrawal . supporters of the mission argued that canadians have made progress in providing schools , health care and clean water for thousands of afghans . they said the improving conditions would be impossible without troops ensuring a secure environment for aid workers and local residents . `` the military needs to be there , '' said harold albrecht , a conservative member of parliament . `` the military provides the civil order we would expect from police here . '' the canadian mission in afghanistan was to end next february . it has claimed the lives of 80 soldiers and a diplomat , according to the associated press . canadian prime minister stephen harper has endorsed a panel 's recommendation to keep troops in place only if another nato nation dispatches additional troops to kandahar . canada wants a minimum of 1,000 reinforcements , the globe and mail reported . thursday 's motion , passed with a 198-77 vote , brought harper 's conservative party and the opposition liberals together on the issue . other parties , however , noted that the cost of maintaining a troop presence in afghanistan has not been disclosed to parliament or the public . `` we must provide clarity to the canadian people , '' said nathan cullen of the new democratic party . `` we believe it to be wrong for our country .

528	lagos , nigeria -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a group of nigerian rebels who wrote a letter to u.s. president george w. bush , stating that they attacked two oil pipelines monday , have asked for former president jimmy carter and actor george clooney to help solve issues in the oil-rich niger-delta . military policemen patrol the creeks of the omadino community in warri south district of the niger delta . in a letter written by a group called movement for the emancipation of the niger delta , or mend , the group said they attacked two pipelines they believed are owned by chevron corp. and shell oil . a spokesman for royal dutch shell said its pipeline was damaged last week . the attack will temporarily cut shipments by 169,000 barrels a day as workers try to repair the damage , the spokesman said . the pipeline is owned jointly by shell and nigerian , french and italian oil companies , the spokesman said . chevron spokesman kurt glaubitz told cnn that `` no chevron pipelines have been vandalized in nigeria . '' there was no immediate comment from the nigerian government . in the letter the group called themselves `` commandos '' and stated that their aim was `` the crippling of the nigerian oil export industry . '' watch how nigeria attacks help hike gas prices '' `` today 's attack was prompted by the continuous injustice in the niger delta region of nigeria where the root issues have not been addressed by the illegal and insincere government , '' the letter stated . the letter stated that two other letters had been sent to bush and also actor george clooney , and the group also asked for president jimmy carter to help . clooney is one of the united nations ' messengers of peace , and has campaigned for an end to the long-standing conflict in darfur , as well as further humanitarian relief efforts in the region . carter is currently in the middle east , where he has met with the exiled militant hamas leader khalid meshaal , on what he calls a `` study mission '' to support peace , democracy , and human rights in the region . `` mend is prepared for talks and will prefer ex president jimmy carter to mediate . mr. carter is not in denial as the rest of you who brand freedom fighters as terrorists , '' the letter stated . `` the ripple effect of this attack will touch your economy and people one way or the other and hope we now have your attention . '' the organization also said they attack was in response to one of the arrest of one of their members , henry okah , who was arrested last year and according to local reports , is charged with treason . since late 2005 , mend militants have carried out numerous attacks on nigeria 's oil sector and abducted dozens of foreign workers , releasing nearly all of them unharmed . in the past the organization has said it had ratcheted up its attacks to redress what it says is the unequal distribution of the nation 's oil wealth . e-mail to a friend .

530	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- striking hollywood writers will be back at their keyboards wednesday after voting overwhelmingly to end a 100-day walkout that essentially shut down the entertainment industry . writers guild of america member steven binder shows his approval as he votes tuesday in beverly hills , california . more than 92 percent of the writers guild of america members who cast ballots tuesday in los angeles and new york voted to end their work stoppage over residuals for writing in the digital age , including new media and the internet . the new deal is for three years . `` the strike is over . our membership has voted , and writers can go back to work , '' said patric verrone , president of the wga 's west chapter . michael winship , president of wga 's east guild , said , `` the success of this strike is a significant achievement not only for ourselves but the entire creative community , now and in the future . '' wga members walked off the job november 5 after talks broke down over how writers are paid for the use of their material on the internet and dvds , among other issues . `` it is not all that we hoped for , and it is not all we deserve , '' verrone said when a tentative deal was announced saturday . but he added , `` this is the best deal this guild has bargained for in 30 years . '' leslie moonves , chief executive officer of cbs corp. , told the associated press , `` at the end of the day , everybody won . `` it was a fair deal and one that the companies can live with , and it recognizes the large contribution that writers have made to the industry . '' the alliance of motion picture and television producers , which represents production companies and media conglomerates , has had no comment on the agreement . the vote meant that the academy awards ceremony on february 24 will be the usual scripted gala , the ap reported . `` i am ecstatic that the 80th academy awards presentation can now proceed full steam ahead , '' without `` hesitation or discomfort '' for the nominees , sid ganis , president of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences , which stages the oscars , told the ap . as long as the strike continued , the traditional oscars spectacular was in doubt since many hollywood stars would not cross wga picket lines . it 's unclear how soon new episodes of scripted programs will start appearing , because production wo n't begin until scripts are completed , the ap reported . it will take at least four weeks for producers to get the first post-strike episodes of comedies back on the air ; dramas will take six to eight weeks , the ap said . verrone said the wga achieved two of three goals through negotiations with the studios . watch verrone explain what he thinks the strike accomplished '' the first goal relates to writers ' `` jurisdiction '' in new media , verrone said , meaning that any content written by guild members specifically for new media , such as the internet or cell phones , will be covered by their contract . the second goal relates to reuse of content in new media , verrone said . the agreement bases payment for reuses on a distributor 's gross formula for residuals , `` so that when they get paid , we get paid , '' he said . it is the `` first time in our history that a new delivery system pays on a residual formula superior to the prior existing system , '' verrone said . the third goal , which verrone said the guild did not achieve , was to shore up writers ' shares of the revenue from animation and reality television . `` giving up animation and reality was a heartbreaking thing for me personally , '' he said . `` but it was more important that we make a deal that benefited the membership , the town as a whole , that got people back to work and that solved the biggest problems in new media .

531	-lrb- aol autos -rrb- -- some drivers would say that the united states is a crazy quilt of speed limits , with an emphasis on the `` crazy . '' a sign indicating the highest speed limit in the country stands by interstate 10 outside of the west texas town of el paso . since 1995 , states have been free to set their own maximum speed limits , leading to long debates on safety standards . to some folks , the speed limits are just insane -- either too low or too high , depending on their views about what makes driving safe . advocates of low speed limits wo n't find much to like about texas . true to its frontier roots , it stands out as the land of the fast getaway . the top rural speed limit is normally 70 mph , but in 2006 it set a maximum daytime speed of 80 miles per hour , the highest speed limit on the country , on more than 500 miles of rural interstate in its southwest corner . this includes parts of interstate 10 between kerrville and el paso and of i-20 between monahans and the i-10 interchange . the speed limit for rural roads in montana is 75 mph . as a result , it takes just three hours to travel the 228 miles from billings to butte at the posted speed . but that 's much slower than a montana driver could have made the trip in early 1999 . at that time there was a six-month speeders ' honeymoon when the state had almost no control over rural speeds , partly as a result of an unfavorable court ruling . st. thomas in the u.s. virgin islands is at or near the other end of the spectrum . in the u.s. territory the speed limit is 20 mph in the city and 30 out in the country . when it comes to accident rates , though , you would be far better off on a montana interstate than competing with the island 's frenetic drivers on the way to paradise point . nationwide , maximum speeds range from 60 miles per hour in hawaii to 75 in most of the west . meanwhile , much of the eastern midwest and the northeast has opted for maximum speeds of 65 mph , although michigan and indiana chose the 70 mph standard more common to the south and the great plains states . so if you are cruising west along i-90 out of ohio , you can enjoy the increase in speed across 150 miles of indiana before illinois ' lower speed limit -- or its state police -- reins you in . as you continue west , interstate speed limits bump up to 70 in iowa , and then you can maintain a steady 75 from nebraska through to the california line , where interstate speeds drop off to 70 again . should you choose to detour into oregon , you 're back down to 65 . from a highway safety standpoint , the patchwork of speed limits at least seems to make sense . speeds are slower in more populous eastern states and faster in the wide-open west , although the insurance institute for highway safety argues that some of the new , higher speed limits out west and elsewhere are costing lives . it estimates that deaths on interstates and freeways have increased 15 percent due to the higher speed limits . but some researchers are skeptical about the link between accidents and high speeds on rural highways , if not on city streets and rural two-lanes . they point to the lower fatality rates on european highways , even though the speeds are generally higher . the maximum legal speed is roughly 80 mph in poland , austria , france and a few other countries . there is no speed limit on much of germany 's autobahn , although some sections are restricted to about 80 mph or less . ironically , the new regime of u.s. speed limits has helped researchers make sense of whether higher rural speed limits are dangerous . political scientist robert yowell , a professor at northeast lakeview college in texas , examined what happened after states began setting higher rural speed limits in 1995 . with the federal 65 mph limit gone , it was possible to compare the accident rates before and after the new limits went into effect . the results were clear : `` by and large , across the 50 states , there was no discernible effect from the higher limits , '' yowell said . `` two or three states actually had a decrease in fatalities . '' once speed limits are raised on interstates , drivers are more likely to get off the more dangerous two lanes and use the faster routes , yowell said . furthermore , the motorists traveling the fastest on the higher-speed interstates tend to be good at that kind of driving . the less competent drivers at high speeds tend to drive more slowly . while yowell admits most states are well-intentioned , he 's `` not willing to accept that speed limits are solely a function of safety , '' he said . `` they are a function of revenue generation as well . there have been cases of judges saying communities have to raise their speed limits because they were obviously being used to raise revenues and that 's not a proper use of the law . '' in part , yowell looks to differences in political cultures to explain the great continental divide in speed limits . `` it may be that certain states have a different approach to questions involving personal liberty versus collective safety , '' he said . his research does n't surprise jim baxter , president of the waunakee , wisconsin-based national motorists association . his organization had lobbied heavily for an end to the federal limits . baxter 's rule of thumb for computing the right speed limit is the traffic engineering standard known as the 85th percentile speed . that 's the speed that 85 percent of motorists drive at or below . but it tends to be well above the speed limits that most jurisdictions set . with the speed limit set at that level , traffic tends to move smoothly , reducing the risk of accidents , baxter said . if you put the limit below that speed , some vehicles are traveling far more slowly than the fastest drivers , creating the most dangerous conditions of all . baxter argues that most drivers naturally tend to drive at speeds that suit the road conditions and their driving skills . st. thomas is a case in point , albeit an extreme one . with its congestion and rugged terrain , the island is bereft of performance cars ; many of the vehicles are older pickups , aging japanese compacts and suvs . the treacherous conditions restrict speeds far more effectively than any local law . as joe aubain , executive director of the st. thomas-st . john chamber of commerce , puts it , `` even if you wanted to go a whole lot faster , you could n't , '' he said . e-mail to a friend .

'' mcwethy left behind two sons , adam , 28 , and ian , 24 , according to the post . his wife , who was with mcwethy at the time of the accident , told the post her husband was a good skier who enjoyed living in colorado . `` he loved it here , '' she told the paper . `` i think he loved the beauty of its nature , the open spaces , the wildlife , everything . '' in his statement , westin said , `` he was one of those very rare reporters who knew his beat better than anyone , and had developed more sources than anyone , and yet , kept his objectivity . '' after working as a reporter for u.s. news & world report , mcwethy joined abc news in 1979 , going on to cover conflicts in bosnia , kosovo and liberia , according to the abc news web site . mcwethy was the network 's primary reporter assigned to secretaries of state james baker , george shultz , warren christopher and lawrence eagleburger , abc said , and he had traveled to more than 50 countries . mcwethy was honored with at least five national emmys during his time at abc and also received an alfred i. dupont-columbia award and an overseas press club award , according to abc news ' web site . `` for three years i watched one of the finest news reporters do what so many in television still can not do to this day : be a reporter first , foremost and always , '' starr said . colleagues said he 'll be missed . `` everyone that knew jack is trading stories today , '' plante said . `` there is nothing but a sense of unambiguous loss on the part of all of his friends , colleagues , competitors and even the uniformed military officers that he covered as a reporter .

'' the reporter cited the fact that obama once failed to put his hand over his heart while singing the national anthem . obama replied that his choice not to put his hand on his heart is a behavior that `` would disqualify about three-quarters of the people who have ever gone to a football game or baseball game . '' the reporter also noted that the illinois senator does not wear an american flag lapel pin , has met with former members of the radical anti-vietnam war group , weather underground , and his wife was quoted recently as saying she never felt really proud of the united states until recently . asked how he would fight the image of being unpatriotic , obama said , `` there 's always some nonsense going on in general elections . right ? if it was n't this , it would be something else . if you recall , first it was my name . right ? that was a problem . and then there was the muslim e-mail thing and that has n't worked out so well , and now it 's the patriotism thing . `` the way i will respond to it is with the truth : that i owe everything i am to this country , '' he said . the first-term senator from illinois has been the subject of various debunked rumors since launching his presidential campaign -- allegations that he is a muslim , that he took his oath of office on a copy of the quran and that he attended a radical islamic school while living in indonesia as a boy . `` you will recall that the reason i came to national attention was a speech in which i spoke of my love of this country , '' said obama . he and his wife , michelle , had already explained her comments . `` she simply misspoke , '' he said . `` what she was referring to was -lsb- that -rsb- this was the first time she has been proud of politics in america . watch what michelle obama said '' `` that 's true of a lot of people who have been cynical and disenchanted . and she 's spoken about how she has been cynical about american politics for a very long time , but she 's proud of how people are participating and getting involved in ways that they have n't in a very long time . '' about not wearing an american flag lapel pin , obama said republicans have no lock on patriotism . `` a party that presided over a war in which our troops did not get the body armor they needed , or were sending troops over who were untrained because of poor planning , or are not fulfilling the veterans ' benefits that these troops need when they come home , or are undermining our constitution with warrantless wiretaps that are unnecessary ? `` that is a debate i am very happy to have . we 'll see what the american people think is the true definition of patriotism . '' obama did not respond to the question about the weather underground , a group whose members bombed the u.s. capitol and the pentagon during the 1970s . last week , the new york sun reported that as an illinois state senator in 2001 , obama accepted a $ 200 contribution from william ayers , a founder of the group who was not convicted for the bombings and now works as a professor at the university of illinois at chicago . but the paper said that , in a statement , a spokesman for the obama campaign , william burton , said , `` sen. obama strongly condemns the violent actions of the weathermen group , as he does all acts of violence ... but he was an 8-year-old child when ayers and the weathermen were active , and any attempt to connect obama with events of almost 40 years ago is ridiculous .

535	johannesburg , south africa -lrb- reuters -rrb- -- his name is `` average '' and the story of his desperate flight from the wreckage of president robert mugabe 's zimbabwe is an increasingly common one . math teacher mawise gumba fled zimbabwe and found his qualifications mean little as a refugee . the tall 34-year-old , slouching exhausted in a johannesburg church that has become a de facto transit camp , is one man in a tide of migrants washing up in south africa . `` there is nothing for me there in our country any more . i had no job and i could not afford anything . even when i was working life was tough , '' he said . `` it 's hard for everyone ... i thought it was better for me here , '' said the former store clerk , whose dusty jeans and boots tell of a long and difficult journey . the tale told by average -- whose name is not unusual in zimbabwe -- is depressingly familiar to a people who have watched their once prosperous land spiral into economic disaster . when mugabe 's government , facing inflation of close to 5,000 percent , ordered companies to halve prices of basic goods and services a month ago -- effectively demanding that they operate at a loss -- average lost his job as the supermarket chain he worked for cut staff . facing the prospect of homelessness and hunger in his own country , he joined the estimated 4,000 zimbabweans who head south to south africa , most of them illegally , every day . mugabe , 83 and in power since the country 's independence from britain in 1980 , has been accused of running zimbabwe 's economy into the ground while implementing a draconian crackdown aimed at keeping power . his decision to launch violent seizures of white-owned farms seven years ago is partly blamed for soaring unemployment and the highest inflation rate in the world . average scraped together his last salary , some money he made from trading sugar bought at a discount from the supermarket where he worked , and funds borrowed from friends to secure a visitor 's visa and bus ticket to johannesburg . a friend who promised to meet him on arrival failed to show up , leaving him stranded without a place to sleep . on wednesday evening he walked into the central methodist church in downtown johannesburg and joined a long queue of people waiting for shelter and food . the church 's homeless shelter has become a virtual refugee camp for 800-900 zimbabweans and a smaller number of migrants from other countries . `` over the past three years , and more so over the past couple of months , i have noted an exponential increase in the number of people we have from zimbabwe , '' bishop paul verryn said . outside his office the line of people waiting for help grew . many of the new arrivals were asleep in their seats . `` we offer them a place off the streets , where they are protected and have warmth from the inclement streets of johannesburg , '' verryn said . at sunset the refugees crowd into the building and lay out reeking blankets . `` people just sleep anywhere they can find a space to sleep . some people sleep on the steps here , in the corridors and others in the foyer and in the meeting rooms , '' said 27-year-old walter rusike from harare . the commerce graduate and his wife and two children share a meeting room with other families and have been at the shelter for four months . average said he hoped to get accommodation for a few days until he finds his friend , work or both . `` i have a diploma in stores management and store control , a certificate in security and a driver 's licence . i think maybe i will be able to find some work with my qualifications . anything will be better than the situation i was in , '' he says . e-mail to a friend . copyright 2007 reuters . all rights reserved.this material may not be published , broadcast , rewritten , or redistributed .

537	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- record oil prices , the sub-prime mortgage mess and slumping stock markets are hardly music to the ears of investors . in tough economic times like these , investors seek out safe , stable investments such as guaranteed government bonds or cds . yet a growing number are being wooed by the sweet sounds , and profits , of something new -- investment funds specializing in high-end musical instruments . the stradivarius violin -- only about 700 are believed to exist -- is the premier investment instrument . talented musicians want them , but ca n't afford them -- one fetched $ 3.5 million at auction . enter nigel brown , winner of the queen 's award for enterprise and chairman of the nw brown group , a financial services company . he brings musician and investor together . `` what happens is , a musician comes along to see me , having fallen in love with an instrument , '' brown says . `` then , what i do is to pull a syndicate of people together to buy this instrument so that the musician can then have the use of it ... '' down the road , the musician can buy the instrument from the investors . they split the profits if its value appreciates . that 's how violinist matthew trusler got his $ 2 million stradivarius . brown loved trusler 's playing and funded the instrument himself . `` they are just the most fantastic violins that were ever made , '' trusler says , clutching his . `` this one was made in 1711 ... and it 's been around for 300 years and it 's a really wonderful violin . '' not everyone is convinced a stradivarius is such a great deal -- particularly modern instrument makers . `` i think if you can get hold of one of the very best strads , not just any strad ... i think they probably give you , as a player , something special , '' says violin-maker andreas hudelmayer . `` but if you ca n't have one of the very few best , you are just as well off with a new instrument . '' his reasoning ? the cost of insuring a stradivarius for just a couple of years would pay for a new , top-quality violin , hudelmayer says . even so , the reality is that old violins are attracting those looking for alternative investments . a new hedge fund called the fine violins fund is dedicated to top-range instruments . the latest studies show exclusive violins are earning a steady 3.5 percent a year since 1850 . that beats u.s. treasury bonds over the same timeframe , with their 2.19 percent average yield . of course , you have to be in the investment game for the long haul . `` they 've proved to be fantastic investments , '' says simon morris , director of beare 's -- a broker and appraiser of high-end violins , violas and cellos . `` for many of the musicians that bought say in the 1960s , they 've been the best pension plan they could 've had . `` like anything , you have to purchase well and sell well . you ca n't just go and buy any old thing . '' but for these investors , the financial return is only part of the investment . `` the fact they make a financial gain is of course gratifying at the end of the day , but it is mostly the support of the musician , '' says brown . `` they like being able to go along to a concert and hear their instrument performed by their artist .

544	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- every day , five u.s. soldiers try to kill themselves . before the iraq war began , that figure was less than one suicide attempt a day . a u.s. soldier patrols the streets of baghdad in january . the dramatic increase is revealed in new u.s. army figures , which show 2,100 soldiers tried to commit suicide in 2007 . `` suicide attempts are rising and have risen over the last five years , '' said col. elspeth cameron-ritchie , an army psychiatrist . concern over the rate of suicide attempts prompted sen. jim webb , d-virginia , to introduce legislation thursday to improve the military 's suicide-prevention programs . `` our troops and their families are under unprecedented levels of stress due to the pace and frequency of more than five years of deployments , '' webb said in a written statement . watch cnn senior pentagon correspondent jamie mcintyre on the reasons for the increase in suicides '' sen. patty murray , d-washington , took to the senate floor thursday , urging more help for military members , especially for those returning from war . `` our brave service members who face deployment after deployment without the rest , recovery and treatment they need are at the breaking point , '' murray said . she said congress has given `` hundreds of millions of dollars '' to the military to improve its ability to provide mental health treatment , but said it will take more than money to resolve the problem . `` it takes leadership and it takes a change in the culture of war , '' she said . she said some soldiers had reported receiving nothing more than an 800 number to call for help . `` many soldiers need a real person to talk to , '' she said . `` and they need psychiatrists and they need psychologists . '' according to army statistics , the incidence of u.s. army soldiers attempting suicide or inflicting injuries on themselves has skyrocketed in the nearly five years since the start of the iraq war . last year 's 2,100 attempted suicides -- an average of more than 5 per day -- compares with about 350 suicide attempts in 2002 , the year before the war in iraq began , according to the army . the figures also show the number of suicides by active-duty troops in 2007 may reach an all-time high when the statistics are finalized in march , army officials said . the army lists 89 soldier deaths in 2007 as suicides and is investigating 32 more as possible suicides . suicide rates already were up in 2006 with 102 deaths , compared with 87 in 2005 . cameron-ritchie , the army psychiatrist , said suicide attempts are usually related to problems with intimate relationships , but they are also related to problems with work , finances and the law . `` the really tough area here is stigma . we know that soldiers do n't want to go seek care . they 're tough , they 're strong , they do n't want to go see a behavioral health-care provider , '' cameron-ritchie said . multiple deployments and long deployments appear to exact a toll on relationships , thereby boosting the number of suicide attempts , she said . traditionally , the suicide rate among military members has been lower than age - and gender-matched civilians . but in recent years the rate has crept up from 12 per 100,000 among the military to 17.5 per 100,000 in 2006 , she said . that 's still less than the civilian figure of about 20 per 100,000 , she said . the `` typical '' soldier who commits suicide is a member of an infantry unit who uses a firearm to carry out the act , according to the army . post-traumatic stress disorder also may be a factor in suicide attempts , cameron-ritchie said , because it can result in broken relationships and often leads to drug and alcohol abuse . `` the real central issue is relationships . relationships , relationships , relationships , '' said u.s. army chaplain lt. col. ran dolinger . `` people look at ptsd , they look at length of deployments ... but it 's that broken relationship that really makes the difference . '' to reduce suicides , the army said it is targeting soldiers who are or have been in iraq for long periods and teaching them to notice signs that can lead to suicide . that training came too late for army specialist tim bowman . the 23-year-old killed himself in 2005 after returning from iraq . `` as my family was preparing for a 2005 thanksgiving meal , our son timothy was lying on the floor , slowly bleeding to death from a self-inflicted gunshot wound , '' said his father , mike bowman , in testimony to a house veterans ' affairs committee hearing in december . `` his war was now over . '' he said veterans return home to find an `` understaffed , under-funded , under-equipped '' veterans affairs mental health system . `` many just give up trying , '' he said . e-mail to a friend .

551	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- serie a champions inter milan have confirmed the dismissal of coach roberto mancini , opening the way for former chelsea manager jose mourinho to replace him . mancini guided inter milan to the italian league title for three successive seasons . ironically , the 43-year-old mancini , who guided inter to three successive italian league titles , is now the favorite to take mourinho 's former job at stamford bridge . inter -- who won the first of their three titles in 2006 because those above them were demoted or deducted points over the matchfixing scandal -- released a statement about the sacking . `` inter milan have informed roberto mancini that he has been relieved of his role as coach , especially because of his comments that he was not going to stay after the end of the season following the champions league tie against liverpool on march 11 , '' read their statement . mancini , however , rescinded those comments the following day declaring that he had made them in the heat of the moment following inter 's elimination from the competition , losing 3-0 on aggregate . inter 's reasons for sacking mancini appear less credible after club president massimo moratti announced that the coach had changed his mind about leaving at the end of the season . `` i 've had a talk with mancini , who confirmed to me that he wanted to stay at inter next year to see out his contract . he wants to win the champions league for us next season , '' moratti said on march 12 . `` mancini 's words surprised me , i did n't expect it and even less so i believe the people close to him . '' mourinho , nicknamed ` the special one ' for guiding porto to the champions league in 2004 and then chelsea to two premier league titles , would not come cheap , but the exit of mancini has cost inter dear too as his contract , which runs till 2012 , will leave him 24 million euros richer as compensation . however , mancini was unable to make inter into viable champions league contenders despite the three serie a titles . mancini is the ninth coaching casualty under moratti , following ottavio bianchi , roy hodgson , luigi simoni , mircea lucescu , marcello lippi , marco tardelli , hector cuper and alberto zaccheroni .

'' clinton was referring to a 2006 bill that obama drafted after an illinois nuclear power plant was found to have released radiation into surrounding groundwater . obama 's original bill would have required power plants to notify the public and government officials when any radiation was released , but subsequent versions had less stringent reporting requirements , the new york times reported . the bill was never voted on by the full senate . clinton also accused obama of supporting `` billions of dollars of breaks for the oil industry '' by voting for an energy bill she opposed and said he did not support the workers of a maytag corp. plant that closed in his home state of illinois . watch clinton attack obama '' reacting to clinton 's charges , obama spokesman bill burton said his candidate `` does n't need any lectures on special interests from the candidate who 's taken more money from washington lobbyists than any republican running for president .

'' cheney responded , `` let me simply thank the senator for the kind words he said about my family and our daughter . i appreciate that very much . ... that 's it . '' but the vice president later slammed sen. john kerry for his remarks about mary cheney when asked about homosexuality during a debate with president bush . the vice president said kerry was `` out of line ; '' wife lynne cheney called him `` not a good man .

556	gerolstein , germany -- mineral water company gerolsteiner have decided to drop their sponsorship of the german protour cycling team , which expires at the end of the 2008 season . german rider stefan schumacher is a member of the gerolsteiner team . gerolsteiner , who have been team sponsors since 1998 , said there was a change in marketing strategy . gerolsteiner has invested around $ 12 million annually in the team , which includes riders stefan schumacher , fabian wegmann , markus fothen and robert foerster . gerolsteiner said on tuesday they were no longer reaching their targeted audience through cycling because it was changing from being solely a producer of mineral water to a supplier of nonalcoholic drinks . gerolsteiner team chief hans-michael holczer was deeply upset by the news . `` there were tears in my eyes , '' said holczer . the german cycling federation -lrb- bdr -rrb- said they would help the team to find a new sponsor . `` it is not an entirely unexpected decision . after such a long collaboration , you notice changes in your partner , '' said holczer , who will begin the hunt for a new sponsor . `` we have one of the best teams on the market with a national and international reputation .

563	san diego , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- on the question of whether recent immigrants assimilate as quickly as previous waves , many americans exhibit short fuses -- and even shorter memories . ruben navarrette jr. notes that immigrants have been criticized throughout history for not assimilating . they have convinced themselves that , instead of adapting to the customs of this country , new arrivals -- most of whom come from asia or latin america -- expect the rest of us to accommodate them . they go ballistic over little things -- mexican flags , taco trucks , libraries that offer bilingual story time , or having to `` press one for english . '' yet , even as they look down on new immigrants , many americans look back fondly upon their immigrant ancestors . legend has it that when grandpa arrived from ireland , germany , italy or poland , he jumped off the boat , immediately draped himself in the american flag , ripped out his native tongue , and abandoned his culture -- all while singing `` yankee doodle dandy . '' germans did not move to milwaukee and make beer and cheese . the irish did not settle in boston and join organizations like the hibernian society to preserve their heritage and culture . and even while americans complain about how the current crop of immigrants are n't like their predecessors , they miss the irony : at the time , there were people who said the same thing about their ancestors ; the germans were thought to not be like the english , the irish were n't like the germans , the italians were n't like the irish etc. . and the chinese were n't like anyone who had come before them , and so they were labeled `` unassimilable '' by the tom tancredos of that era . some things never change . when i was growing up in central california , which is home to a large population of immigrants from southeast asia , thousands would gather to celebrate hmong new year . the local newspaper would do a feature . and , in the days that followed , someone would write an angry letter to the editor complaining that these people were n't melting into the pot . yet , there is more melting going on than one might think , according to a new report from the manhattan institute . billed as the first annual index of immigrant assimilation , the study was written by duke university professor jacob vigdor . it measured three kinds of assimilation : economic -lrb- employment , education , homeownership , etc. -rrb- ; cultural -lrb- intermarriage , english proficiency , family size , etc. -rrb- ; and civic -lrb- citizenship , military service , political participation , etc. -rrb- . far from discovering that recent immigrants are ducking the assimilation process , the study found that `` immigrants of the past quarter-century have assimilated more rapidly than their counterparts of a century ago , even though they are more distinct from the native population upon arrival . '' of course , individual groups still fall behind in some categories . chinese and indian immigrants have low levels of cultural assimilation . mexican immigrants have low levels of economic assimilation . and canadian and indian immigrants have low levels of civic assimilation , since few of them become citizens . but , overall , the news is good . after more than 200 years , america still does an excellent job of assimilating immigrants . even if a particular group tried to resist the process , they would n't stand a chance . assimilation happens , whether the immigrants are ready or not . those are the facts . of course , fear does n't listen to facts . that is something else that has n't changed . ruben navarrette jr. is a member of the editorial board of the san diego union-tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . read his column here . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .

567	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- ecological and conservation groups are praising a move by the environmental protection agency to impose new restrictions on rat poisons to help reduce the threat of accidental exposure to children and wildlife . the rules say only farmers , livestock owners and certified rodent control employees can buy rat poison in bulk . `` we are very happy that the epa has done all it can to get these products off of the consumer market , '' said michael fry , director of conservation advocacy for the american bird conservancy . `` by putting these restrictions in place , they are allowing a compromise to be made between themselves and organizations who have been working on this problem for a long time . '' the epa 's new measures , which were handed down thursday , require that rat poisons be kept in bait stations above ground and in containers that meet agency standards . loose bait , such as pellets , and the four most hazardous types of pesticides , known as `` second-generation anticoagulants , '' will no longer be sold for personal use . under the new restrictions , only farmers , livestock owners and certified rodent control employees will be allowed to purchase rat poison in bulk . bags larger than 8 pounds will no longer be sold at hardware and home-improvement stores . children who come into contact with highly toxic pellets can experience terrible symptoms from digesting them . they include internal bleeding , nosebleeds , hair loss and extensive bruising . between 2001 and 2003 , rat poison was responsible for nearly 60,000 poisonings , according to a study done by the american association of poison control centers . about 250 of these yearly exposures result in serious injuries or death . the epa said it believes the restrictions will not only keep the products out of children 's hands , but also reduce the ecological and wildlife risks associated with exposure to rat poison . bait blocks that are typically placed on the ground use fish and other flavors that attract endangered species , including mountain lions . `` in california , almost every animal tested by the national wildlife service had residues of rodenticides , '' said fry . `` the rat baits are also very lethal to scavengers , because the toxins remain in the rodent 's body long after they initially die . '' although the epa is receiving considerable praise for the initiative , this is n't the first time the agency has worked to combat the threat of rat poison . in 1998 , the epa established two standards for rat poison . the agency required manufacturers to include an ingredient that made the poison taste bitter and use an indicator dye that would make the ingestion of pesticides more recognizable . but regulations were revoked in 2001 after the agency came to a mutual agreement with manufacturers to rescind the requirements . `` we determined that the dye was n't effective in keeping children from being accidentally exposed and the bittering agent actually resulted in a loss of efficiency in controlling rodents , '' said steven bradbury , director of the agency 's division of special review and re-registration . `` in our decision thursday , we felt that we needed an approach that would stop children coming in contact with the pesticides in the first place . that ultimately led to the implementation of bait stations , '' bradbury said . the decision to revoke the requirements led the west harlem environmental action , inc. and the natural resource defense council to file a lawsuit three years later . both organizations saw the retraction as a way to make it easy for consumers to purchase unsafe rodenticides over the counter . according to the west harlem group , inner-city housing and park departments such as the new york city housing authority could continue laying rat baits in public areas that were easily accessible to children . `` studies show that the number of poisonings in minority children is much higher than others , '' said aaron colangelo , a staff attorney at the natural resource defense council . `` not only do we have an environmental health issue , but an environmental justice issue as well .

568	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- suspected islamic insurgents fired mortar rounds at a plane carrying somalia 's transitional president , but no one -- including abdullahi yusuf ahmed -- was harmed , a presidential spokesman said . somali president abdullahi yusuf ahmed , pictured late last month during a visit to france . the attack happened while the plane was about to take off from mogadishu 's airport sunday around 11 a.m. local time , spokesman hussien mohammed huubsireb said . `` al-shaabab has actually tried to harm to president , but thank god nobody was hurt , '' huubsireb said . al-shaabab is an islamic militia that is trying to seize control of somalia . it is a splinter group of the islamic courts union , which ousted somalia 's transitional government in 2006 . the icu was deposed in december of that year following ethiopia 's military invasion . bloody battles between al-shaabab and the ethiopian-backed government forces in mogadishu have forced residents to flee the capital . more than 40,000 displaced civilians have taken shelter in dozens of makeshift settlements west of mogadishu , described by the united nations as `` precarious conditions . '' sunday 's mortar attack is the second assassination attempt on ahmed . the president survived a car bombing in september 2006 outside somalia 's parliament in baidoa that killed at least eight others . somalia 's prime minister ali mohamed gedi has been more frequently targeted by the islamic insurgents seeking to destabilize the government . somalia has been mired in chaos since 1991 , when warlords overthrew dictator mohamed siad barre and sparked brutal clan infighting . somalia 's current transitional government is trying to maintain control of the capital , with the help of the better-equipped ethiopian forces . but the presence of the ethiopians has united various islamic militant groups in somalia , including al-shaabab , who are trying to oust the ethiopian forces and gain control of mogadishu . the united states classified al-shaabab as a terrorist organization in march , partly because of what washington says is the group 's close ties to osama bin laden 's al qaeda militant group .
569	chicago , illinois -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- at a debate in front of thousands of labor union activists tuesday , sen. barack obama 's democratic presidential rivals blasted him for his remarks about pakistan . last wednesday , the illinois senator said that if it were necessary to root out terrorists , he would send u.s. forces into pakistan without the country 's approval . `` you can think big , but remember , you should n't always say everything you think if you 're running for president , because it has consequences around the world , '' sen. hillary clinton said during a 90-minute democratic presidential forum in chicago sponsored by the afl-cio . chicago is obama 's hometown , and clinton 's statement drew boos . the new york senator responded , `` we do n't need that right now . '' despite the frosty reception , connecticut sen. chris dodd joined clinton in criticizing obama . he said obama 's stance could undermine pakistani president pervez musharraf , the country 's military ruler , who has been a u.s. ally in the fight against al qaeda . `` while general musharraf is no thomas jefferson , he may be the only thing that stands between us and having an islamic fundamentalist state in that country , '' dodd said . `` so while i would like to see him change , the reality is , if we lose him , then what we face is an alternative that could be a lot worse for our country . '' obama jumped into the fray . `` i find it amusing that those who helped to authorize and engineer the biggest foreign policy disaster in our generation are now criticizing me for making sure that we are on the right battlefield and not the wrong battlefield in the war against terrorism , '' he said . `` if we have actionable intelligence on al qaeda operatives , including -lsb- osama -rsb- bin laden , and president musharraf can not act , then we should , '' obama said . `` that 's just common sense . '' he also said americans had the right to participate in the debate over such a key aspect of american foreign policy . but clinton countered by saying that while u.s. forces might have to pursue action inside pakistan `` on the basis of actionable intelligence , '' it was `` a very big mistake to telegraph that and to destabilize the musharraf regime , which is fighting for its life against the islamist extremists who are in bed with al qaeda and the taliban . '' `` remember , pakistan has nuclear weapons . the last thing we want is to have al qaeda-like followers in charge of pakistan and having access to nuclear weapons . '' sen. joe biden of delaware responded later in the debate , noting that the strategy obama outlined was already u.s. policy . `` everyone 's entitled to their own opinion , but not their own facts , '' biden said . `` it 's already the policy of the united states -- has been for four years -- that there 's actionable intelligence , we would go into pakistan .

you bet and a lot of them . they get the job done but always needed a bit of spicing up , tabasco sauce that someone would bring to the field , usually . cold weather affected them more than anything . nothing worse than getting the beans and franks in cold weather . the beans would be semi-hard and the franks rock solid . the preservative that they are in gels up and looks like petroleum jelly . had to carry them next to your body to get them warm . to me the worst one was the chicken ala king , disgusting . the desserts were always good . some guys had recipes that you could mix together two or three mres and have a pretty good meal if you had heat and the time to cook it . even though i thought i left them behind when i left the military , i still have them in the car during the winter and when i do ice fishing . they are great in a pinch . annette sweet of leavenworth , kansas this is a different side of life all together ; i believe the best memories were how to heat your mre before they came out with the heating pouch . spaghetti , wow that was a good one , the best way to serve it was to take your mre cheese , a mini bottle of the tabasco that came in the pack and mix it all together and place on the hood of your humvee on a hot day or by the heater on a cold day . umm good . now , the worst ever that i believe they came out with was the loaf , i ca n't even say whether it was meat or vegetables but it really left a very heavy feeling in the pit of your stomach . you can never forget the ham slices ; unfortunately they forgot to slice it , it was about 1/2 inch thick filled with gristle and very salty , very hard to digest . the different assortments of all the mres were , as i call them , charms candy , hard as a rock and stuck to your teeth ; tootsie roll , huge and did n't taste like chocolate ; chicklet gum , send you straight to the throne ; the peanut butter and crackers , well , a bit oily but i considered a keeper . oh , by the way , they did have real coffee . i believe it was tasters choice , not sure though . and fruit loaf , what can you say about a loaf ? once a loaf , always a loaf , and staying with tradition of blended items , you mixed a pack of the powered cream they gave you for the coffee in with just a smidgen of water and you had peaches ala mode . i never went hungry , but sometimes i never was full . i have retired now and have come to appreciate what is good food . it 's being a civilian , sitting at a real table , with silverware , plate and glass , looking back on where i came from and knowing that i ca n't go back in body but in spirit . from a retired soldier , just keeping it real . to all my comrades that came before me , with me and after me , god bless you and thank you for all that you do . suzanne yeltnuh of ahwatukee , arizona i was a victim of hurricanes jeanne , frances and wilma . we had no power for 21 days and the stores were out of food . i stood in lines for hours for ice and mres and was very thankful . i actually think they are very good ! now that i moved to arizona , at least i do n't have to worry about hurricanes!watch as civilians taste mres . clarence ragland of tucson , arizona i not only had mres , but i also had their predecessor , the c ration ! c-rats , as they were called , came with a can opener called a p-38 , and were ok . the mre has come a long way since its inception , and the chicken ala king was one of the best . still have some at home , although i retired from the air force in 2000 . megan sterrett of apo , new york while i was in the middle east in support of operation enduring freedom , i sent an mre to my children so they could see what they were like . my daughter , who was in the second grade , took it in to school for show and tell . one of the girls in the class declared that she would rather eat sand , to which my daughter replied , `` well you can chose to eat this or choose to die .

572	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- some 220 square miles of ice has collapsed in antarctica and an ice shelf about seven times the size of manhattan is `` hanging by a thread , '' the british antarctic survey said tuesday , blaming global warming . scientists say the size of the threatened shelf is about 5,282 square miles . `` we are in for a lot more events like this , '' said professor ted scambos , a glaciologist at the national snow and ice data center at the university of colorado at boulder . scambos alerted the british antarctic survey after he noticed part of the wilkins ice shelf disintegrating on february 28 , when he was looking at nasa satellite images . late february marks the end of summer at the south pole and is the time when such events are most likely , he said . watch aerial footage of the area '' `` the amazing thing was , we saw it within hours of it beginning , in between the morning and the afternoon pictures of that day , '' scambos said of the large chunk that broke away on february 28 . the wilkins ice shelf lost about 6 percent of its surface a decade ago , the british antarctic survey said in a statement on its web site . another 220 square miles -- including the chunk that scambos spotted -- had splintered from the ice shelf as of march 8 , the group said . `` as of mid-march , only a narrow strip of shelf ice was protecting several thousand kilometers of potential further breakup , '' the group said . scambos ' center put the size of the threatened shelf at about 5,282 square miles , comparable to the state of connecticut , or about half the area of scotland . see a map and photos as the collapse progressed '' once scambos called the british antarctic survey , the group sent an aircraft on a reconnaissance mission to examine the extent of the breakout . `` we flew along the main crack and observed the sheer scale of movement from the breakage , '' said jim elliott , according to the group 's web site . `` big hefty chunks of ice , the size of small houses , look as though they 've been thrown around like rubble -- it 's like an explosion , '' he said . `` wilkins is the largest ice shelf on the antarctic peninsula yet to be threatened , '' david vaughan of the british antarctic survey said , according to the web site . `` i did n't expect to see things happen this quickly . the ice shelf is hanging by a thread -- we 'll know in the next few days or weeks what its fate will be . '' but with antarctica 's summer ending , scambos said the `` unusual show is over for this season . '' ice shelves are floating ice sheets attached to the coast . because they are already floating , their collapse does not have any effect on sea levels , according to the cambridge-based british antarctic survey . scambos said the ice shelf is not currently on the path of the increasingly popular tourist ships that travel from south america to antarctica . but some plants and animals may have to adapt to the collapse . `` wildlife will be impacted , but they are pretty adept at dealing with a topsy-turvy world , '' he said . `` the ecosystem is pretty resilient . '' several ice shelves -- prince gustav channel , larsen inlet , larsen a , larsen b , wordie , muller and jones -- have collapsed in the past three decades , the british antarctic survey said . larsen b , a 1,254-square-mile ice shelf , comparable in size to the u.s. state of rhode island , collapsed in 2002 , the group said . scientists say the western antarctic peninsula -- the piece of the continent that stretches toward south america -- has warmed more than any other place on earth over the past 50 years , rising by 0.9 degrees fahrenheit each decade . scambos said the poles will be the leading edge of what 's happening in the rest of the world as global warming continues . `` even though they seem far away , changes in the polar regions could have an impact on both hemispheres , with sea level rise and changes in climate patterns , '' he said . news of the wilkins ice shelf 's impending breakup came less than two weeks after the united nations environment program reported that the world 's glaciers are melting away and that they show `` record '' losses . `` data from close to 30 reference glaciers in nine mountain ranges indicate that between the years 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 the average rate of melting and thinning more than doubled , '' the unep said march 16 . the most severe glacial shrinking occurred in europe , with norway 's breidalblikkbrea glacier , unep said . that glacier thinned by about 10 feet in 2006 , compared with less than a foot the year before , it said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's marsha walton contributed to this report .

575	paris , france -- top-seeded maria sharapova was a shock casualty at the french open on monday when she crashed 6-7 7-6 6-2 against fellow russian dinara safina in paris . ecstasy : safina releases her emotions after her comeback win over maria sharapova in the french open last 16 . bidding for the only grand slam title she has yet to win , new world no. 1 sharapova twice blew big leads in the second set . sharapova 's customary screeches reached maximum volume as the match slipped away , and the noise seemed to annoy fans . they whistled and booed sharapova as she left court suzanne lenglen after the match , and she did n't acknowledge the crowd . `` i ca n't please everyone . it 's not in my job description , '' she said . `` i 'm an athlete , and i go out there and fight my heart out . they paid the ticket to watch me , so they must appreciate me on some level , right ? '' sharapova won five consecutive games in the second set to go ahead 5-2 , and held a match point serving in the next game . she also led 5-2 in the second tiebreaker before losing five consecutive points , then unraveled down the stretch , losing the final four games and 10 of the last 12 points . it was the latest setback for sharapova on clay , her least-favorite surface . `` on this stuff , things happen in a hurry , '' she said . `` it was all in her hands , '' safina said . `` then suddenly it changed . '' safina , the younger sister of two-time grand slam champion marat safin , duplicated her upset of sharapova in the fourth round at roland garros in 2006 . she received a congratulatory text from her brother and said she hopes to join him as the winner of a major title . `` a dream of all our family , '' she said . `` once we do this , we can put the racket on the wall and say we did everything we could . but to get to his level , i still have to work a little bit harder .

576	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the nation 's largest publicly owned utility company may be vulnerable to cyber attacks , according to a new report . in 2007 president bush visited the browns ferry nuclear plant , operated by the tennessee valley authority . the tennessee valley authority , which supplies power to almost 9 million americans , `` has not fully implemented appropriate security practices to protect the control systems used to operate its critical infrastructures , '' leaving them `` vulnerable to disruption , '' the government accountability office found . simply put , that means a skilled hacker could disrupt the system and cause a blackout . rep. james langevin , a rhode island democrat , fears the problem is much larger than just the tva . `` if they are not secure , i do n't have a great deal of confidence that the rest of our critical infrastructure on the electric grid is secure , '' he said . the tva operates 52 nuclear , hydroelectric and fossil-fuel facilities in the southeastern united states . among the government watchdog agency findings : . • the tva 's firewalls have been bypassed or are inadequately configured . • passwords are not effective . • servers and work stations lack key patches and effective virus protection . • intrusion-detection systems are not adequate . • some locations lack enough physical security around control systems . the gao recommends 73 steps to correct the problems in its report to congress . in september , cnn first aired dramatic footage of a government experiment demonstrating that a cyber attack could destroy electrical equipment . the experiment , dubbed `` aurora , '' caused a generator to fall apart and grind to a halt after a computer attack on its control system . the test was conducted by scientists at the idaho national laboratory . in october , the north american electric reliability corp. told congress that 75 percent of utilities had taken steps to mitigate the aurora vulnerability , but langevin said it now appears that congress was misled . a congressional audit of the electric reliability corporation 's claim cast doubt on the assertion that most utilities were taking steps to fix the problem . `` it appears that they just made those numbers up , '' langevin said . `` it is not acceptable . it is outrageous . '' he said the result is there is now no clear picture of how vulnerable utilities are to cyber attacks . the electric reliability corporation -- a nongovernmental group that oversees the power system and comprises members of the industry and some consumers -- told cnn it regrets the confusion . experts told cnn that cooper industries is the only manufacturer of hardware that can close the aurora vulnerability . the company estimated it would need to sell about 10,000 devices to fix the problem nationwide . it has sold just over 100 , it told cnn . langevin said the federal government may need new powers to require utilities to take corrective actions to close cyber security gaps , and he will press to give those powers to the federal energy regulatory commission . the congressman is chairing an emerging threats , cybersecurity , and science and technology subcommittee hearing wednesday afternoon . representatives of the tva , the gao , the federal commission and the electric reliability corporation are to appear before the subcommittee .

who called you ? fallon : the story is -- the facts are that the situation was one that was very uncomfortable for me and , i 'm sure , for the president . one of the most important things in the military is confidence in the chain of command . and the situation that developed was one of uncertainty and a feeling that maybe that i was disloyal to the president and that i might be trying to countermand his orders , the policies of the country . ... the fact that people might be concerned that i was not appropriately doing what i was supposed to do and following orders bothered me , and my sense was that the right thing to do was to offer my resignation . watch fallon break his silence '' phillips : do you feel you were pushed out ? fallon : what was important was not me . it was n't some discussion about where i was with issues . it was the fact that we have a war in progress . we had a couple of hundred thousand people whose lives were at stake out in iraq and afghanistan and we needed to be focused on that and not a discussion on me or what i might have said or thought or someone perceived i said . that 's the motivation . phillips : -lsb- esquire magazine writer -rsb- tom barnett made it appear that you were the only man standing between the president and a war with iran . is that true ? fallon : i do n't believe for a second president bush wants a war with iran . the situation with iran is very complex . people sometimes portray it or try to portray it in very simplistic terms -- we 're against iran , we want to go to war with iran , we want to be close to them . ... the reality is in international politics that -lsb- there are -rsb- many aspects to many of these situations , and i believe in our relationship with iran we need to be strong and firm and convey the principles on which this country stands and upon which our policies are based . at the same time demonstrate a willingness and openness to engage in dialogue because there are certainly things we can find in common . phillips : would have you negotiated with iran ? fallon : it 's not my position to negotiate with iran . i was the military commander in the middle east . i had responsibility for our people and their safety and well-being . it 's the role of the diplomats to do the negotiation . phillips : so when talk of the third war came out , a war with iran , the president did n't say to you , `` this is what i want to do , '' and did you stand up and say , `` no , sir . bad move '' ? fallon : it 's probably not appropriate to try to characterize it in that way . again , do n't believe for a second that the president really wants to go to war with iran . we have a lot of things going on , and there are many other ways to solve problems . i was very open and candid in my advice . i 'm not shy . i will tell people , the leaders , what i think and offer my opinions on iran and other things , and continue to do that . phillips : do you think that cost you your job ? fallon : no , i do n't believe so at all . it 's a confidence issue of do people really believe the chain of command is working for them or do we have doubts , and if the doubts focus attention away from what the priority issues ought to be , then we 've got to make a change . phillips : we talk about your no-nonsense talk and the fact that you had no problems standing up to the president . your critics say that admiral fallon is a difficult man to get along with . are you ? fallon : you probably could ask my wife about that . she would have a few things to say . i think that what 's really important here is that when i was asked to take this job about a year and a half ago , i believe it was because we were facing some very difficult days in iraq and afghanistan and in the region . i had some experience in dealing with international problems . i certainly had a lot of combat experience , and i was brought in in an attempt to make things better . that 's what i went about doing . again , there are things that are important and other things in life that are less so . a lot of the issues that became points of discussion to me were not really important items . the important items were the people , what they 're doing , how to get this job done , how to get the war ended and get our people home . phillips : hillary clinton -lsb- and -rsb- barack obama talk about pulling troops out by next year . john mccain says , no , we 've got to stay the course . what is the best course for iraq right now ? watch what the candidates say about war policy '' fallon : i believe the best course is to retain the high confidence we have in general dave petraeus and his team out there . dave has done a magnificent job in leading our people in that country . again , this situation is quite complex -- many angles . there 's a very , very important military role here in providing stability and security in this country , but that 's not going to be successful , as we know , without lots of other people playing a hand . the political side of things in iraq has got to move forward . that appears to be improving . people have to have confidence in their futures . they want to have stability . they would like to be able to raise their families in peace . they would like to have a job . they would like to look to tomorrow as better than today . it takes more than the military , but the military is essential to provide stability and security . the idea we would walk away from iraq strikes me as not appropriate . we all want to bring our troops home . we want to have the majority of our people back and we want the war ended . given where we are today , the progress that they 've made particularly in the last couple months , i think it 's very , very heartening to see what 's really happened here . the right course of action is to continue to work with the iraqis and let them take over the majority of the tasks for ensuring security for the country and have our people come out on a timetable that 's appropriate to conditions on the ground .

'' mutambara is president of an mdc faction that split from the main party headed by morgan tsvangirai . after tsvangirai 's party won the majority of seats in parliament , the two leaders agreed to join forces in parliament under mutambara 's leadership . both charges stem from an opinion piece written by mutambara in which he criticized president robert mugabe for the way the march 29 elections were handled . raphael khumalo , chief executive of the sunday standard , which published the article , was arrested last month on charges of publishing falsehoods . bush said mugabe 's government is failing on multiple levels . `` we call on the regime to immediately halt all attacks and to permit freedom of assembly , freedom of speech , and access to the media , '' bush said . `` we urge the southern african development community , the african union , the united nations , and other international organizations to blanket the country with election and human rights monitors immediately .

'' watch how the students learned about the scholarship loss '' u.s. officials had said the scholarships were rescinded because israel had denied them exit visas . but mccormack said monday that u.s. authorities did not take up the matter with israel until after the matter became public . israel , which has been criticized for banning hundreds of students from leaving gaza to study abroad , said it considers each application individually . israeli government spokesman mark regev indicated sunday that his country would be willing to grant the students visas . `` this can happen , '' regev said . `` no one has to pressure israel on this issue . we have an interest . a real interest . '' citing security concerns , israel imposed an embargo on the movement of people and goods from gaza after islamic militant group hamas took over the territory last year . palestinians can leave gaza only with israeli permission . hamas has refused to recognize israel 's right to exist , and israel , the united states and the european union have designated it a terrorist organization . mccormack said the seven gaza fulbright students must be interviewed by israeli authorities before they can get visas to the united states . `` should they have a successful visa interview -- and by law i ca n't prejudge an outcome of a visa interview -- then they would be able to come to the united states and pursue their program , '' he said . if the seven are allowed to leave , it would be the first time israel has let students do so from gaza since january , according to palestinian advocacy group gisha . one of the gaza fulbright scholars , hadeel abukwaik , 23 , said she `` laughed like crazy '' from sheer joy when she received sunday 's e-mail . `` i was really hoping for this , but i did n't want to want it too much , '' the software engineering student said by phone monday . `` i did n't want to be disappointed again . `` this is really good news . '' fulbright scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic merit and leadership potential under the u.s. government-funded fulbright program , which was started in 1946 . the scholarships allow u.s. citizens and foreign nationals to study and teach abroad to promote the `` mutual understanding between the people of the united states and the people of other countries of the world .

592	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- from a country which brought the world brands like sony and toyota , there 's another name that 's crept quietly to global prominence . hello kitty , the moon-faced cat with a bow in her hair and no mouth . shintaro tsuji , ceo of sanrio , famous for its hello kitty brand , speaks in the boardroom . she 's one of 450 characters developed by japan 's sanrio group , but she 's by far most popular -- the embodiment of what 's known in japan as kawaii , or the culture of cute . her image adorns some 50,000 objects , from cute , of course , to downright crazy . but there 's nothing cute about the numbers . hello kitty is responsible for more than half of sanrio 's billion dollar annual turnover . her creator and founder of sanrio is the effervescent 79-year-old shintaro tsuji . he told the boardroom 's andrew stevens what he thinks is the marketing secret behind a cultural icon . tsuji : selling something which people want to buy is one of the ways of doing business . but i thought , goods that i want are also something other people want . so we wanted to make goods which people want to send to somebody else as a gift . the idea is that goods are for social communication purposes and that has been accepted worldwide . in addition , to give hello kitty goods as a present is very thoughtful . our three concepts of friendship , cuteness and thoughtfulness have been reaching out to people . it conveys the importance of being friendly . such gestures are necessary for the japanese nation . you care about other people by sending some gifts . those concepts have been accepted worldwide . stevens : my first question to you is sanrio has developed something like 450 characters . why it is hello kitty has stood out so much more than the others ? what is the secret of its success ? tsuji : at first we were using characters which were created by outsiders , such as cartoonists or artists , but in this case we had to pay the royalty . so we decided to create our own characters . we hired many artists and asked them to create various characters . according to our own research , the most popular animal character was a dog then a white cat and the third one was a bear . snoopy already existed as a dog character -- that 's why we went for the second most popular character . we asked the artists to design a character based on a white cat . stevens : let me just ask you a question about your life , growing up . reading your autobiography , you lost your mother when you were 13 years old . you went to live with your auntie . and you describe your life ; your childhood , has been a quite lonely . how do you think that has shaped you in your business life ? tsuji : i felt that the most important thing in your life is to have someone whom you can open up your heart to and talk about anything ; to have many friends whom you can talk with your heart is the most blessed thing in your life . then i asked myself how can you make friends -- in what way people can make a friend with those people . that is not just to avoid behaving , which makes people uncomfortable . but do something , which makes people happy . in this way people can make friends . for example , when people are ill , you can say something to them , or when people did something for you , you say thank you to them . for those kinds of occasions , you send a small present rather than an expensive gift . it is important to show your appreciation since you are able to make good friends in this way . this idea has formed as a business . as a result , hello kitty was created . hello kitty has become known among everybody and it means that people are becoming friends . i am pleased with this phenomenon . stevens : what , in your business career , is the most important lesson you think you 've learnt ? tsuji : a good company means that , first of all , its sale increases each year and secondly it makes profits each year . this is what people call a quality company . but this is not my main concern . obviously , a company should n't lose money . a company can not contribute to a society easily . but for me , it is important to establish a company , which has a good reputation . stevens : much easier said than done , how do you remain true to your original ideas , though , because there are so many pressures from shareholders among other people to make those profits ? tsuji : the company shareholders actually say `` make more profits or dividends .

593	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- u.s. navy ships loaded with supplies for victims of myanmar 's cyclone will sail away from the country 's coast on thursday , after the ruling junta refused for three weeks to allow them to deliver aid . u.s. ships steam in formation off the coast of myanmar on may 23 . adm. timothy keating said the uss essex group would leave the shores of myanmar , also known as burma , on thursday , but that he would leave several heavy lift aircraft in thailand to assist international relief efforts . `` we have made at least 15 attempts to convince the burmese government to allow our ships , helicopters and landing craft to provide additional disaster relief for the people of burma , but they have refused us each and every time , '' keating said in a statement wednesday . cyclone nargis made landfall early last month , killing more than 77,000 people in the southeastern asian country , according to a united nations estimate . some 55,000 others are missing , the united nations said , and as many as 500,000 to 600,000 people , mainly in the irrawaddy delta region , have had to be relocated . the white house issued a statement wednesday saying more than a million victims have yet to receive assistance . watch a discussion of myanmar 's handling of the crisis '' `` i am both saddened and frustrated to know that we have been in a position to help ease the suffering of hundreds of thousands of people and help mitigate further loss of life , but have been unable to do so because of the unrelenting position of the burma military junta , '' keating said . myanmar leaders did grant permission for u.s. planes to deliver aid , a total of 106 plane-loads of supplies worth more than $ 26 million . transportation cost about $ 6.8 million , it said . but the junta never gave permission for the united states to distribute the aid directly to the storm victims , prompting questions about whether some of the assistance went astray . last weekend , u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon guided a conference of 52 donor nations in myanmar , where countries pledged in excess of $ 100 million to help myanmar recover -- and said they are willing to open up their wallets further once aid groups are granted access to the worst-affected areas . the country 's government had asked for $ 11 billion in assistance , saying that the relief phase of the disaster was already over and that it needed the money for reconstruction and rehabilitation efforts . more than a month after the cyclone struck , more than 1 million people affected have received help , elisabeth byrs of the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs said on tuesday . she added that aid has reached nearly half of the people in the irrawaddy delta . however , she said , `` there remains a serious lack of sufficient and sustained humanitarian assistance . '' on tuesday , state department spokesman sean mccormack said that the united states would continue to push to get emergency supplies to the country 's victims . `` we are not going to abandon those ... people , '' mccormack said . of the navy ships leaving the area , he said , they `` are needed elsewhere and there is no rational expectation at this point we will be effectively able to use those assets in an humanitarian relief operation . '' `` our folks will do the forensics on that to see if there are any lessons learned , '' mccormack said . `` we think that to the extent that there has been significant loss of life that we as well as others could have reduced that number had we been allowed to act more quickly with a large-scale intervention .

599	kiev , ukraine -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a planned missile defense system in eastern europe poses no threat to russia , president george bush said tuesday , responding to concerns that the u.s. might use interceptor missiles for offensive purposes . president bush , with president viktor yushchenko , praised ukraine 's democratic and military reforms . `` the missile defense system is not aimed at russia , '' bush said at a news conference in kiev following talks with the ukrainian president . `` it 's viewed as an anti-russian device . well , it 's not . '' his comments came before he left kiev for a nato summit in bucharest , romania , that is expected to highlight divisions over the plan . the summit begins wednesday . russia and some european countries have expressed concerns about the missile defense system . while poland and the czech republic have agreed to host parts of the system , others in europe share russian concerns that the defensive shield could be used for offensive aims . outside the u.s. embassy in kiev on monday , protesters gathered to denounce bush 's visit . they chanted , thrust signs into the air -- one reading , `` yankee go home '' -- and burned an effigy of bush in the street . watch the demonstration '' the u.s. has tried to dissuade opposition over the plan . washington offered to allow russian monitors at the missile sites and to negotiate limits to the system over time . the united states also told russia the system would not be operational until iran test-fires a missile that could threaten europe . many european countries do n't believe the u.s. assertion that the system is needed to guard against imminent threats from iran or north korea . europe is dependent on russia for at least 40 percent of its oil and is reluctant to upset the kremlin . the issue will likely be divisive at this week 's three-day nato summit , where russian president vladimir putin plans to make a rare appearance . putin normally declines invitations to attend . bush is slated to meet sunday with putin in the russian resort city of sochi on the black sea , according to ria novosti . it will be the last meeting between the two men before the outgoing russian president steps down , the russian news agency reported . russia also is unhappy with nato 's eastward march . the alliance has already welcomed former soviet republics such as latvia , lithuania and estonia . bush is pushing hard for georgia and ukraine to join nato as well . before leaving tuesday for bucharest , bush said that russia will not be able to veto georgia 's or ukraine 's inclusion into nato . bush said that both countries should be able to take part in nato 's membership action plan , or map , which is designed to help aspiring countries meet the requirements of joining the alliance . `` i strongly believe that ukraine and georgia should be given map , '' bush said . `` and there 's no tradeoffs , period . '' the u.s. president further said he was working `` as hard as i can '' to ensure the two countries are accepted into the map and that russia will have no power to block their inclusion . in remarks last month , former u.s. ambassador to ukraine steven pifer told the u.s. commission on security and cooperation in europe that nato `` has long made clear that any decision regarding membership is between nato and the country concerned , and not subject to veto by any third party . '' russia is not a nato member but works with the alliance via the nato-russia council . russia 's concerns also align with those of some nato members who oppose welcoming georgia and ukraine into the fold . pifer said last month that nato should strive to maintain good relations with russia , but `` should not allow moscow a veto , either explicit or tacit , over relations between the alliance and third countries . '' allowing russia a say , pifer said , `` would encourage those in russia who wish to reassert a russian-led post-soviet bloc rather than develop a relationship of cooperation and full partnership with europe and the west . '' bush said he phoned putin recently to reassure him on both issues . `` nato is an organization that 's peaceful . nato is an organization that helps democracies flourish . and democracies are good things to have on your border , '' bush said he told putin . ukrainian president viktor yushchenko said his country should be able to start the nato membership process . `` we are not speaking about joining nato ; we are only speaking about map , '' he said at the news conference . `` why should ukraine be deprived of that sovereign right , since the principle of open doors is the basic principle for nato ? '' bush added that ukraine already contributes to nato missions , specifically in iraq , afghanistan and kosovo . ukraine also has demonstrated a commitment to democracy , he said . responding to a reporter 's question , bush denied that the united states might ease off on membership plans for ukraine and georgia if russia acquiesces on the missile shield . both issues threaten to destabilize nato , said jane sharp of the center for war studies at king 's college london , but she has heard particularly sharp criticism of the missile defense plan . `` somebody in the uk ministry of defense said to me , ` we are being dragged along on this missile defense thing to the american trough like pigs with rings in our noses , ' '' sharp said . `` it 's a nuisance for europeans , and i think they are irritated with the czechs and the poles for trying to do deals with the americans .

'' wright said sound bites from his sermons were taken out of context and said the black religious tradition , despite its long history , is in some ways `` invisible to the dominant culture . '' the theology of the black church is a `` theology of liberation , it is a theology of transformation and it is ultimately a theology of reconciliation , '' he said . wright 's remarks came a day after he addressed an audience of 10,000 at a dinner sponsored by the detroit chapter of the national association for the advancement of colored people . watch as wright answers his critics at the naacp event '' reiterating some of the same points from that dinner , wright said , `` being different does not mean one is deficient -- it simply means one is different , like snowflakes .

'' `` only then will liberation , transformation and reconciliation become realities and cease being ever-elusive ideals , '' he said . at the height of the wright controversy , obama gave a speech on race relations , rejecting his ex-pastor 's controversial comments but saying he could not repudiate the man himself . `` i 'm not here for political reasons , '' wright said sunday . `` i am not a politician . i know that fact will surprise many of you because many in the corporate-owned media have made it seem as if i had announced that i 'm running for the oval office . i am not running for the oval office . `` i 've been running for jesus a long , long time , and i 'm not tired yet .

'' human rights watch said in a report that zimbabwe 's electoral commission is partisan toward zanu-pf and lacks both expertise and resources to run the elections properly . an mdc official said this week that leaked correspondence from the electoral commission showed it had asked for 3.3 million more ballots than there are registered voters , including 250,000 extra postal ballots for soldiers and police . tenda biti , the opposition 's secretary-general , said it was an indication of fraud . a hero of the country 's civil war against the white rhodesian government , mugabe became the country 's first black prime minister in 1980 . but nearly three decades later , he has consolidated his rule over all aspects of zimbabwean life , and the country does not appear better for it . his country was once revered for offering its citizens some of the best education and health care in africa , but now , schooling is a luxury and zimbabwe has one of the lowest life expectancies in the world . zimbabwe was once known as the breadbasket of southern africa , but now it is difficult to get even basic food supplies . inflation has skyrocketed to more than 100,000 percent while food production and agricultural exports have dropped drastically . watch reasons for meltdown of zimbabwe 's economy '' part of the economic freefall is traced to mugabe 's land redistribution policies , including his controversial seizure of commercially white-owned farms in 2000 . mugabe gave the land to black zimbabweans who he said were cheated under colonialist rule , and white farmers who resisted were jailed . in 2005 , mugabe launched operation clean out the trash , in which he razed slum areas across the country . mugabe denies mismanagement and blames his country 's woes on the west , saying that sanctions have harmed the economy . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's robyn curnow in beitbridge , south africa , contributed to this report .

604	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a high school valedictorian 's plans to study medicine at a california state university have run headlong into the federal government 's attempts to return him and his family to armenia . arthur mkoyan , 17 , was 2 years old when his family came to the united states . `` i have n't been in armenia since i was 2 , so i do n't really know anything about the place , '' said arthur mkoyan , 17 . `` all i 've seen is just videos my mom has watched on the internet . '' mkoyan 's long-term plans were turned upside down one morning in april when two immigration officers arrived at the door of his family 's house . `` they took both of my parents , and they released my mom because she had to take care of us , since me and my brother are minors , '' he recalled . `` but instead they took my dad away to a detention center in arizona . '' mkoyan , who has a grade-point average above 4.0 -- extra credit for advanced placement classes makes that possible -- is set to graduate next week from bullard high school in fresno , california . watch students from arthur 's school talk about his case '' ten days later , immigration and customs enforcement plans to deport him and his family to the armenian capital city of yerevan , the same city his family fled in fear 16 years ago . back then , mkoyan 's father , ruben mkoian -lrb- he and his son spell their last names differently -rrb- , was a sergeant in an armenian equivalent of a department of motor vehicles , according to a court document . `` he was approached with a bribe to register stolen vehicles . he refused . a co-worker took the bribe . mkoian reported the incident to the chief of the dmv , who told him to mind his own business , '' the document states . `` subsequently , he and his family were subjected to attacks he believed were attempts to silence him about corruption at the dmv . '' in what the family considers one such attempt , their house was set on fire in 1992 . that led the father to send his family to russia and then to the united states , arthur mkoyan said . they arrived in the united states in 1995 on six-month tourist visas , according to virginia kice , a public information officer with immigration and customs enforcement . the family settled in fresno , where mkoian worked as a truck driver and his wife worked in a jewelry store . they set about living their lives , which soon included a younger brother for arthur . but after the visas expired , the family 's application to remain in the united states was denied . in 2002 , an immigration judge ruled that they had no legal basis to remain in the country , kice said . after their application to the board of immigration appeals was rejected , the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals last year denied their petition for a hearing . the court was unpersuaded by the father 's assertion that he might still be subject to reprisal if he were to return . `` mkoian 's fear that armenian officials would be unable or unwilling to protect him seems unfounded because he provided little evidence that they were unable or unwilling to protect him in the past , '' the appeals court said . to kice , it 's a simple matter of enforcing the law . `` i would remind people that this family had ample access to due process , '' she said . `` the case has been in litigation for more than 10 years . immigration experts on every level determined that they had no legal basis to be in the united states . '' she noted that the government agreed to delay their deportation so arthur can graduate with his class . arthur 's schoolmates at bullard are shocked that his academic achievements have n't helped his case . `` it 's really hard to get good grades in this school , '' freshman alex stewart told affiliate kgpe . `` it 's a challenging school , so to get a 4.0 , you really got ta try . '' still , a longer-term reprieve remains possible , if unlikely . sen. dianne feinstein , d-california , may attempt to pass a `` private bill '' that would allow the family to remain in the united states . `` our office is looking into the case , '' said scott gerber , a spokesman for the senator . but the odds against it are long . there is `` almost no chance '' that the family 's quest for a private bill will succeed , said daniel kowalski , editor-in-chief of bender 's immigration bulletin . `` very few are being passed , '' he said . in fact , of the 21 private immigration bills introduced last year , none was enacted . in 2006 , 117 were introduced , and none was enacted ; in 2005 , 98 were introduced , and four were enacted . but the filing itself would buy the family time , since it suspends any efforts to deport the family until the bill 's fate is determined . arthur appeared undaunted . he appealed to a reporter to publicize his e-mail address -lrb- artmkoyan@gmail.com -rrb- so he can forward any letters of support to feinstein . meanwhile , the academic skills he has displayed in fresno may not easily translate to college in armenia . arthur said he understands only a few words of armenian .

'' walters also addressed the stress and notoriety the town has been subjected to , saying the only way he and other residents `` have been able to endure the trauma that has been thrust upon us is through the prayers of the christian people who have sent them up in this community .

'' alleged crimes in the region stem from a brutal counter-insurgency campaign the sudanese government conducted after rebels began an uprising in the darfur region of western sudan in 2003 . the authorities armed and cooperated with arab militias that went from village to village in darfur on a campaign of killing , torture and rape , according to the united nations , western governments and human-rights organizations . the militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels draw strength . about 300,000 people have died in darfur , the united nations estimates , and 2.5 million have been forced from home . in 2005 , the security council cleared the way for possible war crimes prosecutions by the international criminal court , a permanent tribunal set up to handle prosecutions related to genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes . the court is based on a treaty signed by 106 nations -- excluding sudan . prosecutors are investigating offenses in sudan , the democratic republic of the congo , uganda and the central african republic . once the court indicts someone , authorities in one country or another have the power to detain the indicted person for trial at the hague . that has not happened in the case of harun and kushayb . an arrest warrant for harun charges that he was involved in the murder , rape , torture and forced displacement of civilians . the court also says he encouraged such illegal acts in public speeches during his tenure as minister of state for the interior . the criminal court says kushayb led several thousand militia members and personally participated in attacks against civilians . an arrest warrant outlines numerous cases of murder , rape and inhumane acts . in sudan , however , senior government leaders told cnn that reports of atrocities in darfur were exaggerated . `` yes , there has been a war and some people have died , but it 's not like what has been reflected in the media , '' said interior minister ibrahim mahmoud hamid . musa halil , an adviser to sudan 's president , has been accused by the united states of leading a militia responsible for atrocities . and the u.n. security council has frozen his assets . yet he denies any wrongdoing . `` there is no genocide , '' he told cnn . `` most people came to the refugee camps because of the pressure and were used there for political marketing . '' others told a different story . in darfur , eyewitnesses spoke of government airplanes and helicopters attacking defenseless civilians just four months ago . they said the government struck in coordination with militiamen riding horses and camels -- a classic pattern that has unfolded around darfur in recent years . more than 115 people were killed in that attack , they said , and nearly 58,000 people fled . cnn 's nic robertson contributed to this report .

612	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- after months of stalemate , the senate late tuesday passed a huge government spending bill that includes billions of dollars requested by president bush to continue the war in iraq . white house officials have said president bush would sign off on the spending plan if the iraq money was added . the roughly $ 555 billion bill -- which passed 76-17 -- also preserves thousands of earmarks for lawmakers who will deliver them to constituents just in time for the holidays . the final vote came at about 11 p.m. et tuesday -- after hours of debate that included two more attempts by senate democrats to tie war funding to a plan to withdraw u.s. troops from iraq . those efforts failed , as have dozens of others in the house and senate since democrats took control of congress last year . earlier , members voted to add $ 40 billion for the war in iraq that had been removed by the house -- which passed the spending bill on monday . the plan also includes $ 30 billion for troops in afghanistan . sen. joe lieberman , an independent from connecticut who co-sponsored the push to reinstate the iraq money , called its approval `` a very powerful bipartisan message of support for our men and women serving in iraq . '' white house officials have said bush would sign the spending plan if the iraq money was added . in the weeks leading up to the vote , bush had repeatedly pushed members of congress to approve a military spending bill that did not place troop-withdrawal requirements on the military in iraq . the bill wraps together 11 of the 12 government spending bills for 2008 -- except for that of the department of defense , which was already funded . facing a president determined to keep spending in check and a unified republican minority in the house and senate , democrats have been stymied at nearly every turn in their attempts to increase spending on their domestic priorities . fearing a politically dangerous government shutdown , democratic leaders ultimately gave in to bush 's top line number and trimmed $ 22 billion from the measure . but democrats stemmed their losses somewhat by shifting some funding from the president 's priorities to their own . and they added billions more above bush 's top line in `` emergency '' funding for veterans health care , california fires , border security and more . the government spending watchdog group taxpayers for common sense , which scrambled monday to pore over the nearly 1,500-page bill that was made public late sunday night , said it has identified almost 9,000 earmarks worth $ 7.4 billion . many of the earmarks avoided normal congressional scrutiny and were `` airdropped '' -- or slipped in without going through normal committee consideration -- into the final bill , the group said . but sen. robert byrd , d-west virginia , chairman of the budget-writing appropriations committee , said the spending plan represents a dramatic decrease in pork-barrel projects from the one approved by bush two years ago -- when republicans controlled congress . `` the total dollars that are earmarked is reduced -- hear me now -- by 43 percent , '' byrd said tuesday from the senate floor . `` that ai n't chicken feed . '' arguing for a plan that would have begun pulling troops from iraq within 90 days , sen. edward kennedy , d-massachusetts , became emotional as he called the bush administration 's efforts in iraq `` a continuing quagmire . '' `` the best way to end this charade and protect our troops and our national security is to put the iraqis on notice that they need to take responsibility for their future , '' kennedy said . `` unless there 's a binding timeline for the redeployment of our troops , the iraqis will not feel the need to make the compromises essential for a political solution . '' the measure now goes back to the house for approval in its revised form . house speaker nancy pelosi said she expects the bill to pass the house , although she will vote against it because of the war funds added in the senate version . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's ted barrett contributed to this report .
613	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- jeannie longo-ciprelli would be remembered as the greatest female cyclist of her generation even if she had never been an olympic champion . longo-ciprelli : fourth time lucky in atlanta in 1996 . for much of her career , the olympic gold was the one honor to elude the french rider . misfortune , it seemed , was to be her fate every four years , regardless of how many world championships she won in between . in 1984 the first women 's olympic road race coincided with longo-ciprelli 's rise to dominance in the sport . well-placed going into the final lap , she appeared set to challenge in the sprint , only to be knocked off in a collision . by 1988 , longo-ciprelli was a three-time road race world champion , as well as a double winner of the women 's tour de france , and the clear favorite for gold in seoul . but a broken hip a month before the games derailed her preparations . although she recovered enough to ride the road race , she could manage just 21st place . tactical error more disappointment followed in barcelona in 1992 as longo-ciprelli paid the price for a tactical error . with three kilometers to go , she raced away from the peloton and crossed the line in celebration . but she had failed to realize that kathy watt , an unheralded australian , had slipped away from the lead group apparently unnoticed with a lap to go , and finished 20 seconds further in front . four years later , in atlanta , longo-ciprelli , finally cracked her olympic jinx . at 37 , longo-ciprelli was no longer the dominant presence she had once been , but she still possessed the ability to raise her performance for the biggest races , as she had proven by winning her fourth road race world title in 1995 . her preparations were typically unorthodox -- while her rivals were acclimatizing to the atlanta heat , longo-ciprelli trained alone in the mountains of colorado , arriving just two days before the race . the race itself was run in a sudden downpour , which sent many riders crashing and skidding and had the rest struggling to stay on their bikes . unruffled , longo-ciprelli broke clear with two other riders and then launched her gold-winning solo attack 11 kilometers from the finish . longo-ciprelli was back for her fifth and final olympics in sydney in 2000 at the age of 41 , this time claiming bronze in the time trial -- and event in which she had also won silver in 1996 . e-mail to a friend .
614	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- for years , russian arms dealer viktor bout made millions of dollars delivering weapons and ammunition to warlords and militants , officials say . on thursday , bout and his associate , andrew smulian , were arrested in thailand after a series of events that officials said could have come straight out of a spy novel . the men 's capture involved law enforcement agencies from at least five countries , including two undercover agents from the u.s. drug enforcement administration posing as colombian rebels . bout and smulian are accused of conspiracy to provide surface-to-air missiles and other weapons to colombian rebels , said michael garcia , u.s. attorney for the southern district of new york . in a complaint filed by a dea agent , they are said to have conspired to sell millions of dollars worth of weapons to the revolutionary armed forces of colombia , or farc . the u.s. department of state designated the group as a foreign terrorist organization in 2003 . `` this marks the end of the reign of one of the world 's most-wanted arms traffickers , '' garcia said of bout . `` someone will undoubtedly write a book about this case someday , and i can tell you that it will read like the very best work of tom clancy , only in this case , it wo n't be fiction , '' said michael braun , assistant administrator and chief of operations for the dea . secret meetings . the operation began in january , when smulian began meeting with two men who claimed to represent farc but who were actually confidential sources working for the dea . the men expressed interest in buying millions of dollars worth of weapons . at meetings in the netherlands antilles , denmark and romania , smulian discussed the details and logistics of the arms deal with the two agents . at one meeting , the agents were given a digital memory stick containing an article about bout and documents containing photos and specifications for 100 surface-to-air missiles and armor-piercing rocket launchers . smulian explained that a delivery system was in place that would allow the weapons to be air-dropped into colombia , and he told the men that it would cost $ 5 million to transport the weapons . during one meeting , smulian introduced the dea sources to bout over the phone . after that conversation , smulian told one of the sources that the weapons were ready in bulgaria . smulian and bout set up a face-to-face meeting with them to finalize the deal , and that is what happened thursday . the arrests were made thursday afternoon . the charges against bout and smulian cover the period from november through february , according to a written statement from the u.s. attorney 's office and the dea . the united states plans to pursue the extradition of bout from thailand , the statement said . there was no mention of smulian 's fate . bout and smulian are charged with conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization . if convicted , each could get a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison , the statement said . ` i 'm not a diamond guy ' intelligence agencies around the world have tracked bout for years . although some of his work has been legitimate , most has not . he has made deliveries to africa , asia and the mideast using obsolete or surplus soviet-era cargo planes . bout , a former soviet air force officer who speaks multiple languages , has what is reputed to be the largest private fleet of soviet-era cargo aircraft in the world , according to u.s. officials . he acquired the planes shortly after the breakup of the soviet union , the u.s. department of the treasury said in 2005 . at that time , the u.s. treasury announced that it was freezing the assets of bout and his associates , who are all tied to former liberian president charles taylor . taylor is being tried on war crimes charges by the special court for sierra leone . intelligence officials said bout shipped large quantities of small arms to civil wars across africa and asia , often taking diamonds in payment from west african fighters . a 2006 article in foreign policy magazine said that although bout served many third-world leaders , he also aided organizations such as the united nations . `` he made countless trips for the united nations into the same areas where he supplied the weapons that sparked the humanitarian crises in the first place , '' the article charged . it said bout probably committed multiple violations of u.n. arms embargoes . british intelligence officials found evidence in afghanistan that bout had shipped arms to the taliban and al qaeda , as well as circumstantial evidence that he shipped weapons technology into iraq . and the u.s. government said it received information that bout profited $ 50 million from supplying the taliban with military equipment when they ruled afghanistan . bout , who is said to be the inspiration for nicolas cage 's arms dealer character in the movie `` lord of war , '' told cnn in 2002 that he never sold arms to the taliban or al qaeda . he also denied providing weapons and missile-guidance technology to iraq . bout said that his air transport company is legitimate and that he ferried a variety of cargo to africa and to afghanistan since 1992 . he denied that any of it was done illegally or that he was paid in `` blood diamonds '' from africa . `` it 's a lie , '' he said . `` i never touched diamonds in my life , and i 'm not a diamond guy , and i do n't want to go into that business . '' some reports at the time claimed that bout flew into afghanistan just before september 11 , 2001 . but bout told cnn that the last time he was in afghanistan was 1996 and that he never met terror mastermind osama bin laden . e-mail to a friend .

'' his sermon included a prayer asking god to strengthen al-sadr 's mehdi army and `` sharpen their weapons . '' `` what the prime minister stated in his press conference , all that he said that was so far from reality , the nonsense and false accusations he used to cover up his huge failure leading the nation 's affairs , '' al-iqabi said . '' ... we call on all politicians , journalists , intellectuals , civil society institutions , tribal leaders and clergy to visit sadr city to witness the crimes committed by the occupier and government forces . '' in sadr city , nearly 1,000 civilians and fighters are thought to have been killed since late march in fighting between security forces and shiite militants . however , al-saghir said there has been `` good security progress . '' watch as fighting destroys a school '' `` i believe the coming days will witness many developments which will lead to the protection of this city from these gangs , '' he said . he urged people who have grievances to make their voices heard through the political process . he decried those who arm themselves under the pretext of sectarianism or occupation . al-saghir emphasized what he called corruption in sadr city and the role of sadrist followers in promoting it . he noted that imams from the supreme council were booted from several mosques and replaced by politically correct imams , and he said companies have to pay off the sadrists to get contracts . he said fuel tanker drivers face the risk of losing their trucks to fire or theft if they do n't pay off political groups . meanwhile friday , a u.s. soldier was killed in baghdad after a roadside bomb struck the soldier 's vehicle , the military said . the soldier was part of a combat patrol in eastern baghdad when a roadside bomb struck the patrol vehicle at about 6:15 p.m. local time . the soldier 's name is being withheld until family has been notified , the u.s. army 's public affairs department in baghdad said . also friday , the u.s. military said one of the two suicide bombers who struck a wedding convoy this week in northern iraq was a woman `` imitating pregnancy .

616	london , england -- a colombian sculptor has created a mystery at london 's tate modern gallery by refusing to reveal how she seemingly managed to crack open a concrete floor . `` shibboleth '' is colombian artist doris salcedo 's first public commission in the united kingdom . the work by doris salcedo begins as a hairline crack then widens and deepens as it snakes across the full 167 meters -lrb- 548 feet -rrb- of the former power station 's turbine hall . salcedo said `` shibboleth , '' a statement about racism , took her more than a year to make but has revealed little else about its construction . she apparently created it elsewhere and spent the past five weeks installing it in the tate , on the south bank of the river thames . she refused to say how she managed seemingly to crack open a concrete floor . `` what is important is the meaning of the piece . the making of it is not important , '' she said . asked how deep the crack goes , she replied : `` it 's bottomless . it 's as deep as humanity . '' visitors meanwhile are warned not to trip on the crack . tate director nicholas serota insisted the work was no optical illusion . `` this sculpture has been made in the most painstaking , meticulous way by doris and her team before it was slowly inserted into the turbine hall , '' he told the press association . `` it has taken five weeks of work here with very considerable disruption to the hall . it 's not an illusion - it 's there , it 's real . `` from the tate 's point of view , there were only two questions : could we realize it in the way doris envisaged ? and once the piece was created , would it damage the structural integrity of the building forever ? `` the answer to the first was yes , and to the second was no . '' he declined to elaborate further . the installation will be removed next april by filling in the crack . serota said : `` there is a crack , there is a line , and eventually there will be a scar and that scar will remain . it will remain as a memory of the work and also as a memorial to the issues doris touches on . '' the artist said the work of art represents the gap between white europeans and the rest of humanity . wire mesh is on show because it is `` the most common means of control used to define borders and divisions . '' salcedo said of the work : `` it represents borders , the experience of immigrants , the experience of segregation , the experience of racial hatred . `` it is the experience of a third world person coming into the heart of europe . `` for example , the space which illegal immigrants occupy is a negative space . and so this piece is a negative space .

617	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- u.s. health officials said wednesday they have found a contaminant in a blood-thinning drug produced by baxter healthcare corp. that has been linked to more than a dozen deaths in the united states . the drug can keep potentially life-threatening blood clots from forming in the veins , arteries , and lungs . in early february , the food and drug administration launched an investigation and then a recall of some forms of the product . the scrutiny began after a spike in reports of health problems associated with heparin , a drug made by baxter from pig intestines at plants in china and wisconsin . though the cause of the problems has not been determined , fda investigators found `` a heparin-like compound -- that is not heparin -- present in some of the active pharmaceutical ingredients '' in both facilities , said dr. janet woodcock , acting director of the fda 's center for drug evaluation and research . the contaminant , which made up 5 percent to 20 percent of each sample tested , `` reacts like heparin in some of the conventional tests used for heparin , '' which explains why it was not picked up , she told reporters in a conference call . no causal link between the contaminant and the adverse events has been established yet , woodcock said . she added that it was not clear whether the contaminant was added accidentally , as part of the processing or deliberately . it also was not clear whether the contaminant was introduced in the company 's plant in wisconsin or the one in china , woodcock said . though she said the exact structure of the contaminant has not been identified , `` it is similar to heparin glycans . '' glycans are polysaccharides , a complex class of carbohydrate . she added it was unclear whether other heparin products used outside the united states might also contain the product . later this week , the agency will release recommendations on how manufacturers and regulators can screen for the contaminant , she said . last year , pet food made in china was found to be tainted with an ingredient that replaced more expensive protein and that initial tests did not identify as a contaminant . asked if the heparin contamination could be a similar case , woodcock said , `` it 's possible . '' doctors have used the blood-thinner for 60 years with `` no history of any problems whatsoever , '' said the fda commissioner , dr. andrew c. von eschenbach . its intravenous use can keep potentially life-threatening blood clots from forming in the veins , arteries and lungs . von eschenbach said it would be `` disingenuous '' to expect the agency would be able to inspect `` every institution in every case . '' over the last fiscal year , the agency reported having inspected more than 1,000 foreign plants , a record . since the agency issued its report that 19 deaths had been linked to the drug since january 1 , 2007 , it has received word of another 27 deaths , `` but many of those do not fit our definition of this type of event , '' woodcock said . in all , the fda has received 785 heparin-linked reports of adverse events -- including difficulty breathing , nausea , vomiting , excessive sweating and plummeting blood pressure that can lead to life-threatening shock . `` they 're continuing to come in fairly rapidly because there has been a lot of reporting of this , '' she said . in a written statement , baxter said its tests have suggested `` that the root cause may be associated with the crude heparin , sourced from china , or from the subsequent processing of that product before it reaches baxter . '' meanwhile , scientific protein laboratories llc , which supplies the company with the active pharmaceutical ingredients , issued a statement saying it is working with the fda , baxter and outside experts to identify the cause of the adverse events . `` thus far , no conclusions have been reached about the root cause , '' it said . `` it is premature to conclude that the heparin active pharmaceutical ingredient sourced from china and provided by spl to baxter is responsible for these adverse events .

'' she did not elaborate on the number of people injured or the extent of their injuries . witnesses told cnn that saturday morning 's action by armenian riot police was bloody , but the u.s. official said there were no confirmed deaths or serious injuries . an armenian woman interviewed by cnn said there was `` huge chaos '' when police moved in . `` these are innocent people , '' she said . `` they just want their freedom . they just want to be heard . they are being beaten up , some people have horrible wounds . '' she asked that cnn not use her name because she feared for her safety . as night fell saturday , the sounds of gunfire could be heard from the direction of the protesters ' gathering , and tracer fire could be seen in the sky , according to another yerevan resident , who also asked not to be identified out of fear for his safety . the man said his wife saw two demonstrators hit by a police car earlier in the day . the car initially did not stop , he said , but the protesters surrounded the car , dragged the officers out and burned the vehicle , he said . the officers were able to escape , he said , but he did not know the condition of the protesters who were struck . the protests began soon after the february 19 presidential election . opposition presidential candidate levon ter-petrosian lost to prime minister serzh sarkisian , a political ally of outgoing president kocharian . the opposition party immediately accused the government of vote fraud and demanded that the results be voided . ghazarian said sunday that the government had reached out to the opposition . `` we are hoping with the help of the international community , the opposition , the leader of the opposition , will come and enter a political dialogue rather than continuing this debate on the streets , '' she said . haroutiun khachatrian , editor of the noyan tappan news agency , told cnn that riot police arrested several hundred people in the square saturday morning , including many opposition party officials . ter-petrosian was there but was not arrested , he said . the opposition vowed to pursue its claims through legal means . the organization for security and co-operation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- monitored last month 's armenian election and concluded that it was mostly in line with international standards , although it did include some criticism in its report . the u.s. embassy has warned the several hundred americans living in yerevan to stay at home and avoid the downtown area where the demonstrations have been taking place , the u.s. official said . armenia , population 3 million , is a former soviet republic east of turkey , south of georgia and north of iran . e-mail to a friend .
621	bucharest , romania -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- france has agreed to send a battalion of troops to eastern afghanistan , a nato spokesman has said . canadian nato-led soldiers walk patrol near kandahar , afghanistan . james appathurai told reporters at a briefing that the move will help nato meet canada 's requirement that it send more troops to the volatile southern province of kandahar , where canadian troops are based . canada agreed this month to extend its commitment of about 2,500 troops until 2011 so long as nato contributes more troops to kandahar . there is a `` clear unity in the alliance '' that the mission in afghanistan must succeed , appathurai said . though 25 nato allies and 13 other countries have contributed forces , the bulk of the recent fighting has been done by u.s. , canadian , british and dutch troops . appathurai also said thursday that he did not expect nato applicants georgia and ukraine to be put on a membership action plan this summit but , he said , the general sense in terms of membership for the two countries is not `` whether , but when . '' further discussions regarding those two countries is to resume thursday , he said . u.s. president george w. bush has pushed for the admission of ukraine and georgia to the military alliance . however , russia -- which is not a nato member -- has expressed concerns about the former soviet republics joining nato , which has already made members of other former soviet countries latvia , lithuania , and estonia . appathurai also said a general consensus could not be reached on macedonia 's bid , because of greece 's objections . greece has threatened to veto macedonia 's bid if its northern neighbor does not agree to change its name . athens has long argued that the name macedonia implies territorial claims on its northern province of the same name -- the birthplace , also , of greece 's most revered ancient warrior , alexander the great . the name issue must be resolved by the two countries , appathurai said . e-mail to a friend .

625	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the top military and civilian leaders of the u.s. air force were forced out thursday over the handling of nuclear weapons , the defense department secretary said . air force chief of staff gen. michael moseley , left , and secretary michael wynne have stepped down . chief of staff gen. t. michael moseley and secretary michael w. wynne resigned over the department 's concern over two incidents , including the august flight of a b-52 bomber that flew across the country with nuclear weapons . `` focus of the air force leadership has drifted '' in terms of handling nuclear weapons and equipment , defense secretary robert gates said . in august , a b-52 bomber flew from north dakota to louisiana with the crew unaware that six nuclear-tipped missiles were on board . four officers were relieved of duty afterward , including three colonels . gates also cited this year 's discovery that components designed to arm and fuse nuclear warheads were accidentally shipped to taiwan in 2006 . watch gates talk about the firings '' critics also cite last month 's news that the air force 's 5th bomb wing failed a defense `` nuclear surety '' inspection -- despite having months to prepare and being under close scrutiny after the previous incidents . the inspection found deficiencies in the wing 's ability to protect its part of the nation 's nuclear stockpile . the resignations come after a report on a navy admiral 's investigation that criticized the air force 's reactions to the incidents . gates said the report `` depicts a pattern of poor performance '' in which air force brass did n't act to improve security after mishaps and air force personnel handling nuclear weapons consistently failed to follow existing rules . air force leaders `` not only fell short in terms of specific acts , they failed to recognize systemic problems , to address those problems or , when beyond their authority to act , to call the attention of superiors to those problems , '' gates said . the investigation found that although the taiwan incident did n't compromise the integrity of the u.s. nuclear force , it represented `` a significant failure '' by the air force to ensure sensitive military components , gates said . gates said the report concluded that erosion in the branch 's command and oversight standards helped lead to the incidents , and that they could have been prevented if the oversight programs had functioned correctly . he said he asked for the resignations after consulting president bush . sen. carl levin , the democratic chairman of the senate armed service committee , welcomed gates ' decision . `` secretary gates ' focus on accountability is essential and had been absent from the office of the secretary of defense for too long , '' levin said . `` the safety and security of america 's nuclear weapons must receive the highest priority , just as it must in other countries . '' rep. edward j. markey , a massachusetts democrat and a senior member of the house homeland security committee , also welcomed the resignations . markey said he 's long been concerned about what he called a series of dangerous air force missteps in handling nuclear weapons . `` the magnitude and frequency of these errors indicate a deep-seated problem within air force culture , practice and training , '' markey said . `` the entire department of defense should immediately recommit itself to ensuring the safety and security of our nuclear stockpile before one of these mistakes has lethal consequences . '' a senior military source said the august nuclear weapons incident was the straw that broke the camel 's back but that other leadership issues also factored into moseley 's and wynne 's resignations . a previous investigation into the b-52 flight uncovered a `` lackadaisical '' attention to detail in day-to-day operations at the air bases involved , an air force official said in october . maj. gen. dick newton , assistant deputy chief of staff for operations , said the investigation found `` a failure to follow procedures '' by `` a limited number of airmen '' at the two bases . newton defended the procedures themselves . wynne is not the first secretary of a military branch to resign since gates became defense secretary . in march 2007 , gates announced the resignation of army secretary francis j. harvey in the wake of reports of substandard conditions at walter reed army medical center in washington . cnn 's jamie mcintyre and barbara starr contributed to this report .
626	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- a woman who helped raise a child with her female partner in vermont before the pair split can visit the girl in virginia even though that state does n't recognize same-sex unions , a court ruled friday . janet jenkins with isabella , the daughter she helped raise with former partner lisa miller . virginia 's supreme court ruled that janet jenkins and lisa miller 's civil union in 2000 gave vermont , and its law on same-sex unions , jurisdiction over their subsequent custody and visitation disputes . miller moved to virginia with the child in 2003 , and a vermont court granted jenkins visitation rights . but miller took the case to a virginia court , which ruled that jenkins had no such rights there . the case was considered by legal experts to be the first conflict between two state courts over a major legal question arising from same-sex unions . jenkins ' attorney , joseph price of the washington law firm arent fox , said friday 's ruling `` just affirms the old principle that when these kinds of custody and visitation disputes begin in one state , that 's where they should remain . '' `` you ca n't shop them around to another state , '' price said . `` virginia really had no choice but to enforce judgments and judicial orders from vermont . '' vermont is one of the few states that allow same-sex partners to enter into a civil union . two years after vermont recognized miller and jenkins ' relationship , miller gave birth to a daughter , isabella , conceived through artificial insemination . the relationship deteriorated , and miller and the baby moved to virginia . a vermont court later granted miller a dissolution of the civil union and granted custody of the child to her and visitation rights to jenkins . miller then asked the courts in virginia -- which does not recognize same-sex unions or marriages -- to take jurisdiction of the dispute . a virginia state judge eventually ruled that jenkins had no `` parentage or visitation rights . '' the virginia high court ruling friday returned the case to vermont 's control , meaning jenkins can visit the girl , who is now 6 . miller 's attorney , mathew staver , said he was `` disappointed the state sidestepped the larger legal questions . '' `` this case shows that one state is not an island in the same-sex marriage dispute , and underscores having state laws that protect traditional one-man , one-woman marriages , '' said staver , chairman of liberty counsel , a law firm that fights on behalf of what it calls `` traditional families . '' miller said in 2005 that she was doing what was best for her daughter and was no longer a lesbian . `` i am isabella 's mom . i did conceive her ; i birthed her , '' she said . `` i 'm raising her . and in my opinion , isabella needs to stay with me 100 percent of the time , because i am the only person that she identifies as a mom . '' miller lives with isabella in winchester , virginia . jenkins did not offer an immediate reaction to the ruling but said in 2005 that she was only fighting for her rights as a parent . `` justice will be served for isabella , '' she said . `` i believe that . and i 'll do whatever it takes . i 'll be with her for as long as i can , or i 'll be without her for as long as i have to , but i 'm her mom . `` she 's born here -lsb- in vermont -rsb- . she 's always here . '' price said jenkins , who lives in fair haven , vermont , was supposed to visit isabella last weekend , but miller did n't appear with the girl . friday 's ruling comes a week after the california supreme court 's refusal to delay its recent decision legalizing same-sex marriage in the state . massachusetts also allows same-sex marriages ; vermont and three other states permit civil unions , and 12 other states give gay and lesbian couples some legal rights . virginia amended its constitution in 2007 to decree that marriage is defined as a union between one man and one woman .

628	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- english football fans hoping to travel to moscow for this month 's champions league final between manchester united and chelsea face spiraling costs and an anxious wait for visas amid a simmering diplomatic row between the uk and russia . chelsea fans hoping to follow their side to moscow face hefty expenses and an anxious wait over visas . upwards of 50,000 fans are expected to travel to the may 21 match from the uk , defying expensive flights and warnings about a shortage of accommodation in the russian capital -- one of the world 's most expensive cities . but there were fears on thursday that russia 's stringent visa requirements for british citizens could further complicate matters for fans . in a statement , the russian embassy in london pledged to fulfil its obligations to enable all fans with tickets to the game to travel . but it also criticized the uk government for tightening restrictions on russians traveling in the opposite direction , imposed following the apparent murder of the exiled russian dissident alexander litvinenko in 2006 . `` if we had an agreement similar to the one russia has in place with eu , most problems could have been avoided , '' the statement said . the embassy also criticized the uk for imposing `` cumbersome '' visa requirements on supporters of the russian side , zenit st. petersburg , which could reach the uefa cup final in manchester on may 14 , including biometric tests , online-only applications and interviews with consulate officials . but there was speculation as well on thursday that moscow may be prepared to temporarily lift some visa requirements in a gesture of good will . the uk 's times newspaper quoted a foreign ministry spokesman as saying that russian authorities would waive the need for visa applicants to produce a letter of invitation in the case of ticket holders . uefa communications director william gaillard praised russia 's flexibility on wednesday and said a simplified visa application procedure could be in place by the end of the week . `` the russians have shown great flexibility and hopefully within the next 48 hours we will be announcing a more simplified procedure for visas to make it easier for fans to get to moscow , '' gaillard told the uk 's press association . manchester united chief executive david gill said on wednesday that those traveling on official club packages were assured of a visa . `` if you are on an organized trip , your ticket will be your visa . the actual specifics and fine details will be addressed in the next day or so and then we will communicate with the fans . `` everyone recognizes in order for it to be a showcase , which it clearly will be , you have to ease entry into the country while not totally doing away with what the russian authorities require . '' but gill warned that demand for tickets would leave many fans disappointed : `` we could sell well over 100,000 tickets for this final , so there will be a lot of disappointed people . '' both united and chelsea have each received around 21,000 tickets for the match . but with officially allocated tickets expected to be snapped up by season ticket holders and loyalty scheme members , many more fans are expected to travel to moscow independently . flights from london to moscow on the day of the match , returning the following day were available for around $ 1,600 over the internet on thursday . but the british foreign office web site advised thursday that there were no hotel vacancies in moscow and warned supporters that they would not be able to find a room on arrival . meanwhile , uk sports minister gerry sutcliffe urged fans to be on their best behavior in moscow , warning that trouble could derail england 's bid to host the 2018 world cup . `` i was really impressed and pleased that the european champions final will be an all-english final but that brings some responsibilities for the teams involved and their supporters , '' sutcliffe told pa. . `` it should be a great advert for the premier league and for english football but it will also be the place everyone will be looking at if anything goes wrong . `` if that happened it would not only be damaging for the two teams participating but could also have a big impact on the reputation of our game at a time when we are trying to encourage football nations to support our world cup bid . '' with the match due to kick off at 2245 local time , the british foreign office web site advised supporters `` not to let alcohol spoil their champions league final experience , '' pointing out that smoking and drinking in red square are illegal . `` the foreign and commonwealth office is providing detailed information for those fans who are traveling , '' said minister for europe jim murphy . `` so i encourage those who are going , to look at the specific travel advice on how to enjoy a trouble-free and successful visit to moscow .

629	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the transportation security administration said friday its officers at a texas airport appear to have properly followed procedures when they allegedly forced a woman to remove her nipple rings -- one with pliers -- but acknowledged the procedures should be changed . the woman involved -- mandi hamlin -- told reporters earlier friday she was humiliated by last month 's incident , in which she was forced to painfully remove the piercings behind a curtain as she heard snickers from male tsa officers nearby . the incident occurred at the lubbock , texas , airport . the officers `` rightly insisted that the alarm that was raised be resolved , '' the tsa said in a statement posted on its web site friday afternoon . `` tsa supports the thoroughness of the officers involved as they were acting to protect the passengers and crews of the flights departing lubbock that day . '' however , `` tsa has reviewed the procedures themselves and agrees that they need to be changed , '' the statement said . `` in the future , tsa will inform passengers that they have the option to resolve the alarm through a visual inspection of the article in lieu of removing the item in question . '' hamlin and her lawyer , celebrity attorney gloria allred , said they want a public apology from the agency , as well as a guarantee that future passengers with piercings will be treated with dignity and respect . allred pointed out that tsa 's web site says passengers with piercings can undergo a pat-down inspection if they do not want to take their piercings out -- an option she said hamlin was never offered . `` the conduct of tsa was cruel and unnecessary , '' allred told reporters at a news conference . `` last time that i checked , a nipple was not a dangerous weapon . '' she said if an apology was not forthcoming , `` mandi is going to have to consider her legal options . '' attempts by cnn to reach allred for a response to the tsa statement friday afternoon were unsuccessful . tsa said in its statement it acknowledges `` that our procedures caused difficulty for the passenger involved and regrets -lrb- the -rrb- situation in which she found herself . we appreciate her raising awareness on this issue and we are changing the procedures to ensure that this does not happen again . '' the incident occurred february 24 as hamlin , 37 , was preparing to fly to dallas-fort worth from lubbock , where she had been visiting her elderly great-uncle . hamlin said she also has navel and ear piercings and has never set off a metal detector or been singled out for additional screening at an airport . she did not set off the metal detector at lubbock international airport , but was pulled to the side for additional screening , allred said . a hand wand used by a tsa officer beeped when it was waved over her breasts . hamlin told the officer she had nipple piercings , allred said , and that officer called over another officer , who told her she would need to remove them . `` ms. hamlin did not want to remove her nipple piercings , '' allred said , reading from a letter she sent tsa . `` after nipple rings are inserted , the skin can often heal around the piercing and the rings can be extremely difficult and painful to remove . in addition , once removed , the pierced skin may close up almost immediately , making it difficult and painful to reinsert the piercing . '' more officers were called over , and the group grew to four male and two female tsa officers , according to hamlin . also , a small crowd of onlookers had started to gather . the officers insisted that hamlin remove the nipple rings , allred said . `` she felt humiliated by the scene that the tsa officers were making , '' allred said . `` with tears streaming down her face , she again asked to show the piercings to a tsa officer instead of having to remove them . she was told , however , she would not be allowed to fly unless she removed them . had she been told that she had a right to a pat-down , she would have chosen that option . '' she eventually was taken to a private area behind a curtain to remove the piercings , allred said . one came out easily , but the other would not , and she called to an officer that she was having trouble and would need pliers . she was handed a large pair , allred said . `` as ms. hamlin struggled to remove the piercing , behind the curtain she could hear a growing number of predominately male tsa officers snickering in the background , '' allred said in the letter . `` mandi hamlin was publicly humiliated . ... clearly , this is not how passengers should be treated . '' watch the passenger demonstrate removing the jewelry '' afterward , hamlin underwent another scan , but realized she had forgotten to remove her navel ring . she offered to remove it , allred said , but an officer told her it was not necessary because he could see it . hamlin wondered why a similar visual inspection of her nipple rings would not have sufficed , allred said . `` i would n't wish this experience upon anyone , '' hamlin told reporters . `` i felt surprised , embarrassed , humiliated and scared . no one deserves to go through this . '' in a statement earlier friday , the tsa said it `` is well aware of terrorists ' interest in hiding dangerous items in sensitive areas of the body . therefore , we have a duty to the american public to resolve any alarm that we discover . '' tsa included in its statement a picture of a prototype training device it will use to simulate a `` bra bomb '' in training and testing its officers . hamlin said she had to visit the person who originally pierced her nipples to get the rings reinserted , and said the process was excruciatingly painful because of the scar tissue that had formed . `` people who are pierced should not be snickered at , should not become the object of ridicule , should not be singled out for special and uneven and unequal treatment , '' allred said . `` they should be respected just like everybody else . '' she said she had received a call from tsa 's public affairs office friday morning . `` we hope that means they 're going to jump on this and do something about it , '' she said . `` we want tsa to do the right thing now . we 're going to give them the opportunity .

631	baghdad , iraq -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- court proceedings in the trial against tariq aziz , one of the best-known faces of saddam hussein 's former regime in iraq , and several co-defendants have ended after being in session only briefly tuesday . the trial of tariq aziz , pictured here in a baghdad courtroom in july 2004 , has begun . the trial , which is to resume may 20 , was delayed because one of the defendants , ali hassan al-majeed , also known as `` chemical ali , '' was not present because he was ill . iraqi procedural codes require that all defendants be in court for the first session . chief judge raouf abdul rahman read a u.s. medical report signed by three doctors that said al-majeed is in critical condition after suffering a heart attack two weeks ago . he has been released from the hospital but still requires daily treatment and doctor visits . the report said that traveling to court from his detention facility could worsen his health . he can not walk up stairs or sit in court for long hours , it said . he will need three weeks to recover and may need some sort of surgery , the report said . it added he is diabetic and suffers from `` acute heart failure . '' treatment includes clearing of the arteries followed by either open heart surgery or stents in the arteries , but neither option is available at this time , the report said . ali hasan al-majeed , who was a top baathist official during the saddam hussein era , is awaiting execution after being convicted of genocide in connection with the killing of kurds during the anfal campaign in the late 1980s . aziz , al-majeed and six others are now facing trial for having a role in the execution of 42 iraqi merchants in 1992 . a former deputy prime minister , aziz was the first to be called into court , followed by six other defendants . aziz appeared frail , walked slowly with a cane , and was coughing and blowing his nose . he was sitting in the seat saddam hussein used during his appearances in court and was represented by a private attorney . the court was sorting out which defendants did not have attorneys present . this is the fourth major trial of former hussein regime officials since his government was overthrown . the most prominent was the 2006 trial that led to the execution of hussein and three lieutenants for a crackdown in the shiite town of dujail in which more than 140 men allegedly plotting hussein 's assassination were executed . aziz 's lead attorney , badie aref -- who was an attorney for hussein in that trial -- is charged with contempt of court in iraq and has been in jordan since a warrant for his arrest was issued last year . he said he would return to baghdad for this trial only if he were assured he would not be arrested . meanwhile , amid a swirling , blanketing sandstorm , fierce fighting in baghdad tuesday saw u.s. troops kill 32 `` enemy forces '' in a gunbattle , according to the u.s. military . iraqi authorities reported 16 people were killed in a residential area in the same clash . the iraqi interior ministry said the fighting was in the predominantly shiite sadr city neighborhood in eastern baghdad . five suspected insurgents dressed in iraqi army uniforms attacked the home of a human rights worker in diyala on tuesday , killing the resident of the home and an iraqi soldier who lived in the neighborhood , according to the u.s. military . two iraqi civilians also were injured in the small-arms attack . `` attacking civilians in their homes is both criminal and barbaric , '' said major peggy kageleiry , spokeswoman for the military 's multi-national division - north . insurgents have been attempting to exploit the harsh conditions , which have curtailed flights coming into baghdad international airport . sandstorms make it easier for militants to screen their activities and harder for u.s. air power to be deployed effectively . a u.s. military spokesman said fighting began around 9:30 a.m. when militants fired at a u.s. patrol and wounded an american soldier . when the soldier was being evacuated , a u.s. vehicle was struck by two roadside bombs and peppered with small-arms fire and rocket propelled grenades . that left two more soldiers injured . three more soldiers were wounded in the fighting . soldiers used a `` combination of weapon systems available , including a guided multiple launch rocket -lrb- gmlr -rrb- system '' to fight the insurgents and killed at least 28 militants in a four-hour long battle , the military said . lt. col. steven stover , spokesman for multi-national division-baghdad , said three gmlrs were launched , at 11:23 a.m. , 1:03 p.m. and 1:37 p.m. officials with iraq 's interior and health ministry told cnn 16 people were killed and 45 people were wounded when u.s. rockets hit at least three houses in a residential area in sadr city around 1:15 p.m. two children and a woman were among the dead and four children and five women were among the wounded , they said . asked if he was aware of reports of civilian casualties from the strikes , stover said , `` if there were civilian casualties , i sincerely regret them . `` the rockets struck militants firing from buildings , alleyways and rooftops . it was these militants who initiated the engagement by attacking u.s. soldiers . our soldiers have a right to defend ourselves . '' two u.s. soldiers were killed tuesday in separate incidents in northwest baghdad , the military said . the first soldier died from wounds suffered from insurgent small-arms fire at about 8:50 p.m. local time in northwest baghdad , according to a u.s. military public affairs office . the second soldier died at about 10:15 p.m. when the vehicle he was riding in was struck by an improvised explosive device . the names of both soldiers were being withheld until their families could be notified . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's jomana karadsheh , christine theodorou , mohammed tawfeeq and ingrid formanek contributed to this report .
632	belgrade , serbia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.s. embassy in belgrade is evacuating all nonessential personnel following thursday 's attack on the building by a crowd of protesters , a spokesman for the embassy told cnn friday . serbian riot police stand in front of the damaged u.s. embassy in belgrade on friday . the u.s. ambassador , cameron munter , is staying , officials said . the embassy was closed friday , and a handful of riot police holding shields stood outside the building , its outer walls blackened from fires set the night before and some of its windows smashed . it will remain closed until monday or tuesday so officials can assess the damage , said bill wanlund , the embassy 's spokesman . he said embassy staff were still in a heightened state of alert but there were no specific threats against any staff members . the united states has warned the serbian government that it has a responsibility to protect its assets . a top u.s. diplomat was asked during an interview on cnn if the serbian government `` gets '' the warning . `` they 'd better get it , because they have a fundamental responsibility to protect our diplomats and our embassy and to protect american citizens , '' said undersecretary of state for political affairs r. nicholas burns . `` what happened yesterday in belgrade was absolutely reprehensible . '' watch burns ' angry comments on belgrade attack '' thursday 's violence erupted after demonstrations by thousands of serbs against kosovo 's declaration of independence . the anger directed against the united states and other countries for recognizing the breakaway province as a nation sparked attacks on western embassies and shops by hundreds of people . burns said there was an `` insufficient '' number of security people guarding the u.s. embassy at a demonstration everyone knew would take place . he said security `` melted away '' as `` the mob attacked our embassy . '' `` this kind of thing should not happen in a civilized country . it does n't happen in the united states of america . it does n't happen in most world capitals . so the serb government needs to reflect seriously about the responsibility it has under the vienna convention , '' he said . burns , the third highest ranking diplomat in the state department , said he told the serbian prime minister , vojislav kostunica , and his government that the u.s. `` would hold them personally responsible for the safety of our people . '' `` they assured me that they would have adequate security on the ground today and for every day to come . we will hold them to that commitment , '' burns said . demonstrators only managed to break into one u.s. embassy building , which wanlund said was rarely used by staff . he said the protesters did n't manage to get any documents or embassy materials . only marines and security guards were present at the embassy when the angry mob of about 100 approached the walls . in addition to the u.s. embassy , the protesters attacked other western interests including the embassies of britain and germany , as well as a mcdonald 's restaurant and a nike shop . `` one might understand the emotion , but not the violence , and that 's what the serb government needs to remember , '' burns said . burns , who is stepping down in march , has long been involved in trying to resolve tensions in the former yugoslavia . the situation was complicated by sunday 's unilateral declaration of independence by serbia 's predominantly albanian region of kosovo . kosovo is revered historically by orthodox christian serbs but also is claimed as separate and distinct by its ethnic muslim albanians . the wisdom of recognizing kosovo independence has been questioned by many observers , who say the united states wo n't recognize other unilateral declarations of independence . some opponents of kosovo 's independence say recognition is a bad precedent if it 's unilateral and not done in a bilateral , diplomatic setting . they say it will give others the incentive to stage their own breakaway nations . burns said every situation has its unique set of circumstances , as does kosovo , which was the victim of ethnic cleansing policies by the slobodan milosevic regime in 1999 . nato troops fought serbia in an air war then and pushed serbian forces out of the region . since then kosovo has been run by the united nations and with security supplied by nato forces . e-mail to a friend .
633	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- author arthur c. clarke , whose science fiction and non-fiction works ranged from the script for `` 2001 : a space odyssey '' to an early proposal for communications satellites , has died at age 90 , associates have said . visionary author arthur c. clarke had fans around the world . clarke had been wheelchair-bound for several years with complications stemming from a youthful bout with polio and had suffered from back trouble recently , said scott chase , the secretary of the nonprofit arthur c. clarke foundation . he died early wednesday -- tuesday afternoon et -- at a hospital in colombo , sri lanka , where he had lived since the 1950s , chase said . `` he had been taken to hospital in what we had hoped was one of the slings and arrows of being 90 , but in this case it was his final visit , '' he said . in a videotaped 90th birthday message to fans , clarke said he still hoped to see some sign of intelligent life beyond earth , more work on alternatives to fossil fuels -- and `` closer to home , '' an end to the 25-year civil war in sri lanka between the government and ethnic tamil separatists . `` i dearly wish to see lasting peace established in sri lanka as soon as possible , '' he said . `` but i 'm aware that peace can not just be wished -- it requires a great deal of hard work , courage and persistence . '' clarke and director stanley kubrick shared an academy award nomination for best adapted screenplay for `` 2001 . '' the film grew out of clarke 's 1951 short story , `` the sentinel , '' about an alien transmitter left on the moon that ceases broadcasting when humans arrive . as a royal air force officer during world war ii , clarke took part in the early development of radar . in a paper written for the radio journal `` wireless world '' in 1945 , he suggested that artificial satellites hovering in a fixed spot above earth could be used to relay telecommunications signals across the globe . he is widely credited with introducing the idea of the communications satellite , the first of which were launched in the early 1960s . but he never patented the idea , prompting a 1965 essay that he subtitled , `` how i lost a billion dollars in my spare time . '' his best-known works , such as `` 2001 '' or the 1953 novel `` childhood 's end , '' combined the hard science he learned studying physics and mathematics with insights into how future discoveries would change humanity . david eicher , editor of astronomy magazine , told cnn that clarke 's writings were influential in shaping public interest in space exploration during the 1950s and '60s . watch how clarke stands among sci-fi giants '' `` he was very interested in technology and also in humanity 's history and what lay out in the cosmos , '' eicher said . his works combined those `` big-picture '' themes with `` compelling stories that were more interesting and more complex than other science fiction writers were doing , '' he said . tedson meyers , the chairman of the clarke foundation , said the organization is now dedicated to reproducing the combination of imagination and knowledge that he credited the author with inspiring . `` the question for us is , how does human imagination bring about such talent on both sides of the brain ?

'' clarke was knighted in 1998 . he wrote dozens of novels and collections of short stories and more than 30 nonfiction works during his career , and served as a television commentator during several of the apollo moon missions . though humans have not returned to the moon since 1972 , clarke said he was confident that a `` golden age '' of space travel was just beginning . watch clarke talk about sci-fi vs. reality '' `` after half a century of government-sponsored efforts , we are now witnessing the emergence of commercial space flight , '' he said in his december birthday message . `` over the next 50 years , thousands of people will travel to earth orbit -- and then , to the moon and beyond . space travel and space tourism will one day become almost as commonplace as flying to exotic destinations on our own planet .

635	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- austrian investigators monday released more details about the elaborate underground cellar where josef fritzl kept his daughter imprisoned for 24 years , along with three of their children . josef fritzl admitted to authorities he raped his daughter and fathered her children . investigators believe fritzl planned to build the cellar as early as 1978 , shortly after , according to his daughter , he began raping her at age 11 or 12 , said police spokesman franz polzer . the 73-year-old austrian began building the dungeon as part of an addition to his home that year , and simply added the hidden space -- which was not recorded in any building plans -- polzer said . it took fritzl until 1983 to finish the addition , polzer said . investigators recently discovered another door to the dungeon prison , which was blocked by a 500-kilogram -lrb- 1,100-pound -rrb- steel and concrete door that fritzl probably stopped using when he later constructed an electronic door for a second entrance , polzer said . fritzl , who police believe was the only one with access to the cellar , had to travel through an elaborate maze to get to the prison . `` you would have to open up a total of eight doors , and ... -lrb- for the -rrb- last door which would go into this space -lrb- where the family was imprisoned -rrb- , you would also have to use electronic opening apparatus , '' polzer said . `` we will have to find out perhaps later from now if perhaps there are other spaces we have n't discovered yet , and perhaps maybe there is something else interesting . '' fritzl was recently arrested and confessed to holding his daughter , elisabeth , captive in the dungeon under the fritzl home for decades , repeatedly raping her and fathering seven children -- six of whom survived . three of the children were adopted by josef fritzl and his wife after he concocted the ruse that elisabeth had left the babies on their doorstep . the story of the family 's imprisonment began to unravel more than two weeks ago , when one of the children still in the dungeon , 19-year-old kerstin fritzl , fell seriously ill with convulsions . the father agreed to take her to a hospital , the first time she was allowed out of the prison where she had spent her entire life with her mother and two brothers . dr. albert reiter , who is treating kerstin , said monday that while her condition is still `` grave , '' it `` has improved somewhat . '' `` she has become more stable , but despite that we have to continue to keep her under sedation and give her respiratory help , '' reiter said , noting it is not clear how long she will be kept under sedation . elisabeth and her two sons were reunited with her mother , rosemarie , who police say knew nothing about the basement prison . they were also reunited with the three children that josef had taken from elisabeth . the reunited family is living in secluded quarters at a psychiatric clinic , where they are finding a daily routine and adjusting to sunlight -- something the two boys had never seen -- according to the clinic 's chief doctor . `` the mother and the smallest child have , in just the last couple of days , increased their sensitivity to light , '' dr. berthold kepplinger said . `` so we have been able to equip them with protective sunglasses . '' five-year-old felix is `` getting more and more lively , '' kepplinger said . `` he 's fascinated by everything that he sees around him -- the fresh air , the light , and the food -- all of these things are helping them , '' he said . `` slowly the color of their skin is changing back to a more normal -lrb- shade -rrb- . '' he also said the family members are still getting to know each other and live together as a family . kepplinger praised elisabeth for having provided a daily living routine for her children during their captivity . he said the family is getting into a new routine in which the mother and the grandmother make breakfast for the family , and the children make their beds . however , he said there is a noticeable difference between the pace of life of the children held in captivity and that of those who grew up in fritzl 's home . he said the mother , elisabeth , takes breaks and naps several times a day . the health of the family members is satisfactory and hospital staff have been able to let more and more light into the rooms where the family is staying , kepplinger said . kepplinger said the children , after being confined to a small space their entire lives , are finding it increasingly easy to be in larger spaces . initially the dungeon where fritzl held his daughter was only 35 square meters . in 1993 , around the time elisabeth was pregnant with her fourth child , fritzl decided to add to the dungeon , building another room that increased the entire living space of the family to about 55 square meters . on wednesday or thursday , prosecution authorities will attempt to question fritzl -- who is no longer talking to police following his initial confession , state prosecutor gerhard sedlacek said . a warden at the st. poelten jail , where fritzl is being held , told cnn that fritzl appears to be doing well , but he is refusing to go on walks outside the building where he is detained . e-mail to a friend .

'' that 's when i realized how fast the herd was approaching the cliff . but with predictions of a recession now more common than fed rate cuts -- and that 's saying something -- maybe now it 's time to look at a worst-case scenario . after all , considering all sides of an issue , no matter how extreme they may be , does n't make you a crazy person ; it makes you an educated one . so to understand what a real meltdown could look like , i turned to nouriel roubini , chairman of rge monitor and professor of economics at new york university 's stern school of business . he 's also a former adviser to the u.s. treasury department . professor roubini recently laid out what he called the `` 12 steps to financial disaster . '' unfortunately , they were really complicated , and i have severe add , so i 've boiled them down into five phases that even a rodeo clown like me can understand . i think of these like our military 's `` defcon '' -- or defense readiness condition -- scale , except that this countdown could end in the meltdown of your bank account : . • defconomy five . how you 'll know we 're here : the housing downturn turns into a free fall , making it the worst collapse in our country 's history . that not only triggers massive numbers of foreclosures and lost household wealth , but it also sets off another large wave of bank write-downs . odds we get here : roubini told me that it 's `` extremely likely , even unavoidable '' that we hit this stage because `` the excess supply of new homes in the market is like we 've never seen before . '' prices , he believes , `` need to fall another 10 to 20 percent before that clears . '' • defconomy four . how you 'll know we 're here : americans upside-down on their mortgages and unable to pay their home equity loans begin defaulting on other debt , like credit cards , car loans and student loans . in addition , bond insurance companies lose their perfect credit ratings , forcing already troubled banks to write down another $ 150 billion . odds we get here : high . roubini says that 8 million households are already upside-down on their mortgages and he thinks we could see that number go to between 16 million and 24 million by the end of 2009 . a lot of those people , he believes , will simply walk away from their homes and send their keys back to the bank . • defconomy three . how you 'll know we 're here : some banks begin to crack under the pressure of continuing write-downs and mounting defaults by consumers . a national or large regional bank finally collapses , triggering hedge fund failures and general chaos on wall street , potentially leading to a 1987-style market crash . odds we get here : very good . roubini says that we 'll likely socialize the losses , `` effectively nationalizing the mortgages or the banks . '' it would be , he told me , `` like northern rock -lrb- the large bank in england that was recently taken over by the british government -rrb- times three . '' he thinks the stock market will head south throughout the year as fears about a severe recession are confirmed . • defconomy two . how you 'll know we 're here : most forms of credit -lrb- both to consumers and businesses -rrb- become virtually nonexistent . that results in a `` vicious circle '' of additional write-downs , stock market losses , and bank collapses , which leads to even less credit being available . odds we get here : good . roubini says that credit conditions are becoming worse everyday across a variety of markets and wo n't be getting better anytime soon . without extra credit available , people might have to actually -lrb- gasp ! -rrb- live within their means . • defconomy one . how you 'll know we 're here : welcome back to 1929 . a full economic meltdown results in a complete failure of the underlying financial system . what will be known to future generations as `` the greater depression '' has arrived . odds we get here : not likely . roubini believes that this will be a `` very painful and severe recession '' that could last for 18 months or more , but it will be more like 1981 than 1929 . families may be eating soup again , but at least it 'll be in their own kitchens . now , do i think any of what you just read will happen ? i have no idea , and that 's exactly the problem . i 'm not an economist or a stockbroker ; i 'm just a guy trying to make the best decisions i can , and picking the brains of real experts helps me do that . but i do know one thing for sure : depressions are n't advertised in advance . last time around we went from the roaring '20s to bread lines in a matter of just a few years . anyone who says that ca n't happen again either does n't know history , does n't understand how interconnected the world 's economies have become , or is lying to you . while that does n't mean you should panic , it does mean you should prepare -- something my grandfather would 've done a long time ago . e-mail to a friend .

651	tehran , iran -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- iraq 's prime minister nuri al-maliki on sunday tried to allay iranian fears over a planned u.s.-iraq security pact , saying his government would not allow iraq to become a launching pad for an attack on its neighbor . iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , left , greets iraq 's prime minister nuri al-maliki on sunday . `` iraq today does n't present any threat as it used to be in the times of the former regime , '' al-maliki told iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad during a sunday meeting between two leaders , according to a statement from the prime minister 's office . `` today 's iraq is a constitutional state based on the rule of law , and it seeks to develop its relations with the regional countries based on cooperation and mutual respect , '' al-maliki said . earlier , iran 's state-run news agency irna quoted the iraqi leader as saying that `` baghdad would not allow its soil to be used as a base to damage the security of the neighboring countries , including iran . '' his remarks come as the united states and iraq are trying to reach a bilateral agreement on how long the u.s. military will remain in iraq and what role it will play in iraq 's security . but al-maliki media adviser ali hadi said negotiations between iraq and the united states are in their `` very early stages '' and were not part of sunday 's talks . watch ahmadinejad and al-maliki sit down for talks '' `` the treaty is purely an iraqi-american treaty . the iranians have nothing to do with it , '' hadi said . `` we will not discuss the progress or the key elements of agreements or disagreements with them because this is an iraqi issue . '' the proposed u.s.-iraqi pact has triggered street protests in iraq , where many suspect the deal could lead to the establishment of permanent american bases , a long-term presence of u.s. troops and a weakening of iraqi government control over those troops . shiite cleric muqtada al-sadr , whose militia was the target of a u.s.-backed iraqi clampdown in basra and baghdad recently , has called for weekly protests against the agreement . al-maliki and ahmadinejad met sunday afternoon , with ahmadinejad calling on iraq 's neighbors and the united nations to help restore security and stability to iraq , irna reported . and al-maliki thanked ahmadinejad for his call for an end to longstanding u.n. sanctions against iraq that date back to the 1991 persian gulf war . iran has long called for the withdrawal of u.s. troops from iraq , which the united states invaded in 2003 . meanwhile , the united states has accused iran of arming and training `` criminal '' shiite militias in iraq and of seeking to develop nuclear weapons , allegations the iranians deny . it is al-maliki 's third visit to iran since he became prime minister more than two years ago . the two countries , which are neighbors , both have shiite muslim majorities , and al-maliki 's ruling coalition is dominated by shiite religious parties long backed by iran . adnan pachachi , a leading sunni arab member of iraq 's parliament , told cnn he wanted al-maliki to call on iran to stop supporting armed factions in iraq . `` i think this has to stop , '' pachachi told cnn . `` i hope that mr. maliki will make it absolutely clear that iraqis of all parties , of all sectarian origins and ethnic origins , are strongly opposed to iran 's attempt to interfere in iraq 's affairs . '' pachachi , a former foreign minister , said al-maliki 's predecessor , ibrahim al-jaafari , allowed iraq 's security forces to be dominated by sectarian and ethnic militias , and that u.s. troops should remain until those influences are weeded out . `` in the long run , it is in the interest of the united states to have a secure iraq and armed forces and security forces of iraq with undivided loyalty and allegiance to the state and not influenced by sectarian affiliations or party loyalties , '' he said .

'' he echoed sentiments expressed earlier in the day by prime minister nuri al-maliki , who said the government will not accept the existence of a nongovernment armed force . word of the casualties came as the u.s. military said its highest death toll in seven months reflected an effort by iraqi militants to reassert themselves after weeks of government crackdowns . watch how civilians are dying in the urban fighting -lrb- graphic content -rrb- '' three u.s. soldiers in iraq were killed wednesday in two roadside bombings , the u.s. military said . the first incident occurred about 1 a.m. during a walking patrol in northern baghdad , the military said . the other two died about 4:50 p.m. when an improvised explosive device detonated in southern baghdad , the military said . names of the soldiers were withheld pending notification of their relatives . another u.s. soldier died wednesday in a bombing in the northern iraqi province of ninevah , according to the military . the deaths bring the april death toll for the u.s. military to 50 , the highest monthly tally since september . most of the deaths occurred in and around baghdad , and most were combat-related . since the war in iraq began , in march 2003 , 4,062 u.s. service members have died . over the past several weeks , militants have increased mortar and rocket attacks against civilian , government and military targets , said gen. kevin j. bergner , spokesman for multi-national force-iraq . `` these indirect fire attacks have killed some 40 people in baghdad , with some 370 others injured , '' he said . troops `` are responding appropriately to these lethal attacks . as we do so , we use precision strikes and take precaution to limit the damage , '' bergner said . `` we have said all along this will be a tough fight .

'' earlier , there was an aura of a pilgrimage at the site where the controversial tree once stood before school administrators had it removed . many people touched the ground and some retrieved a lump of dirt , said cnn 's eric marrapodi . he said the part of the town he was in was ill-prepared for the crowds -- no water or toilets were available . in the background , groups shouted `` black power '' and `` no justice , no peace . '' the estimated 15000 to 20,000 demonstrators shut down the town of 3,000 in central louisiana . many residents left for the day , and government agencies , businesses and schools were closed . sgt. tim ledet of the louisiana state police said protesters in buses were still bringing people to town at midday because of the gridlock , but many protesters got off and walked into town on foot . `` there is just no room to maneuver in this small town , '' he said . jena resident terry adams disagreed with any accusations that there might be a black-white divide in the area . `` we are not a racial town . we get along with each other , we get along fine . this is something that got out of proportion . it really has . '' jena 's racial tensions were aggravated in august 2006 , when three white teens hung the nooses the day after a group of black students received permission from school administrators to sit under the tree -- a place where white students normally congregated . the guilty students were briefly suspended from classes , despite the principal 's recommendation they be expelled , according to donald washington , u.s. attorney for the western district of louisiana . a member of the lasalle parish school board -- which had a role in supporting suspension instead of expulsion -- insisted the board is not prejudiced . the panel felt it took the appropriate action , jonny fryar said . `` i talked to one of the parents , who called me and said their son thought it was a prank and naive to the fact of what it meant and he was sorry , '' he said . `` i hate to see people label us as something we are not . because we have black students and white students playing football together . they shake hands , get along . this is an unfortunate incident . we hope that the community can heal . '' although washington acknowledged the fbi and other investigators thought the noose incident bore the markings of a hate crime , a decision was made not to press federal charges because the case did n't meet federal criteria . the students were under 18 and had no prior records , and no group such as a ku klux klan was found to be behind their actions . on december 4 , about three months after the nooses were discovered , six teens , dubbed the jena 6 , were accused of beating classmate justin barker . the six -- mychal bell , robert bailey jr. , carwin jones , bryant purvis , theo shaw and jesse ray beard -- were originally charged with attempted second-degree murder and conspiracy , according to lasalle parish district attorney reed walters . bell , the only one of the six who remains in jail , was to be sentenced thursday after convictions for aggravated second-degree battery and conspiracy to do the same , but both charges have been vacated , awaiting further action by the district attorney . charges for bailey , jones and shaw also were reduced to battery and conspiracy when they were arraigned , while purvis still awaits arraignment . the charges for beard , who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime , are unavailable because he 's a juvenile . tina jones , purvis ' mother , condemned walters . `` i hope that the d.a. will wake up and realize that he 's doing the wrong thing , and to release these kids , '' she said . `` it 's not equal . the black people get the harsher extent of the law , whereas white people get a slap on the wrist per se . so it is not equal here . '' jones maintained that her son was not involved in the beating , but watched from a railing , and was not arrested that same day . `` we have a long fight ahead of us , and we 'll keep fighting until justice prevails in jena , '' the mother said . purvis , who accompanied her , was asked how he 's faring . `` i 'm doing pretty good . i hope there is a pretty good outcome of what 's taking place today , '' he said . watch an interview with one of the jena 6 and his mom '' president bush , who was asked about the rally at a news conference , said , `` the events in louisiana have saddened me . i understand the emotions . the justice department and the fbi are monitoring the situation down there . `` all of us in america want there to be fairness when it comes to justice .

'' sharpton called jena the beginning of the 21st century civil rights movement . `` there 's a jena in every state , '' jackson told the crowd in jena on thursday morning . joann scales , who brought her three teenage children on a two-day bus journey from los angeles , california , to jena , made the same point . `` the reason i brought my children is because it could have been one of them '' involved in an incident like the one in jena . `` if this can happen to them -lsb- the jena 6 -rsb- , it can happen to anyone , '' scales said . ondra hathaway was on the bus with scales . `` if this young man -lsb- bell -rsb- was railroaded to do time as an adult , how many more people has that happened to ?

'' `` my speech to you is about the siege of gaza and the way to liberate it , '' he said . `` the gaza siege is a direct result of annapolis , '' he adds , apparently referring to the site of november 's summit in annapolis , maryland , where israeli and palestinian leadership agreed to work toward a two-state solution . the voice also calls on `` muslims in the neighboring countries '' to support the `` mujahedeen in iraq . '' the broadcast comes a day after another statement attributed to the al qaeda leader condemned european countries for siding with the united states in afghanistan and for allowing the publication of cartoons considered insulting to islam 's prophet , mohammed . `` this is the greater and more serious tragedy , and the reckoning for it will be more severe , '' the speaker in the five-minute audio recording says . the speaker said muslims have not responded by mocking jesus , whom they consider a prophet as well . `` the laws of men which clash with the legislation of allah the most high are null and void , are n't sacred and do n't matter to us , '' he said . the speaker dismissed claims of free speech in his statement , citing european countries ' laws against denying the existence of the holocaust . bin laden also said in his earlier message that `` the crownless king in riyadh '' -- saudi arabia 's king abdullah -- could have prevented the publication of the cartoons `` if it mattered to him . '' `` if there is no check on the freedom of your words , then let your hearts be open to the freedom of our actions , '' he said . though the voice sounds like bin laden , cnn has not been able to confirm that it is him . however , a radical islamist web site reported earlier wednesday that a statement from bin laden was coming soon . the notice appeared on al-ekhlaas , known for carrying statements and videos from al qaeda and its allies . analysis of previous statements has indicated that bin laden was the speaker , and a u.s. intelligence official said there was no reason to think the recorded voice was not bin laden 's . bin laden , who was behind the terrorist network 's september 11 attacks , has been in hiding since the u.s. assault on afghanistan that followed those strikes . his last public statement was an audio message issued in december , when he urged his followers in iraq to continue battling u.s. troops there . wednesday marked the fifth anniversary of the u.s.-led invasion of iraq . the latest statement included no date reference beyond the cartoon controversy , which began in late 2005 when a danish newspaper published a dozen cartoons about islam , including one that depicted mohammed wearing a turban resembling a bomb . violent protests erupted in early 2006 after other european newspapers reprinted the images as a matter of free speech . some muslims believe it is forbidden by the quran to show an image of the prophet at all , and others were offended that the cartoon by artist kurt westergaard appeared to depict mohammed as a terrorist . westergaard said he wanted his cartoon to say that some people exploited the prophet to legitimize terror . several newspapers in denmark reprinted the controversial cartoons in february after danish authorities arrested several people who were said to be plotting a `` terror-related assassination '' of the cartoonist . that sparked violent protests in three afghan cities this month , with muslim students burning flags and chanting anti-western statements . the message said the publication of the drawings in question `` came in the framework of a new crusade in which the pope of the vatican has played a large , lengthy role . '' pope benedict is scheduled to visit the united states next month , with scheduled stops at the white house , the united nations and ground zero , where the twin towers stood until al qaeda 's attack . deputy commissioner paul j. browne of the new york city police department said the department `` has been working closely with the united states secret service to provide the highest level of protection possible '' during the pope 's visit to new york . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's octavia nasr and pam benson contributed to this report .

661	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- democratic rivals hillary clinton and barack obama spent their last debate before next week 's super tuesday contests pointing out differences on iraq , health care and the economy -- but without all of the finger-pointing that 's marked their campaigns . sens. barack obama and hillary clinton struck a mostly cordial tone during the debate . the exchange was in sharp contrast to previous debates because of the absence of political sniping , yet was one of the most substantive policy discussions yet in the race for the nomination . on iraq , obama said he 'd be more able to end the war because he opposed it from the beginning . he said clinton 's vote to authorize the use of force there would undermine her efforts to bring it to an end . `` i think it is much easier for us to have the argument when we have a nominee who says , ' i always thought this was a bad idea -- this was a bad strategy , ' '' he said . clinton defended her vote , saying she was told by the white house that it would be used initially to return weapons inspectors to see whether saddam hussein had an active weapons program . see where they stand on iraq . `` i believe strongly that we needed to put inspectors in , '' the new york senator said . `` that was the underlying reason why i at least voted to give president bush the authority , put those inspectors in , let them do their work , figure out what is there and what is n't . '' watch reaction to clinton 's thoughts on iraq '' both obama and clinton said they support ending the war . on health care , obama defended a plan he says would make insurance affordable to everyone who wants it , but not require everyone to buy it . the illinois senator said his proposal would require that all children be covered and allow young people to remain on their parents ' health insurance up to age 25 -- but would not require adults to purchase care . watch candidates discuss their differences '' `` every expert who looks at it says there wo n't be anybody out there who wants health care who will not be able to get it , '' he said . watch the rivals discuss health care '' clinton , who as first lady spearheaded her husband 's ultimately failed health care reform effort in the early '90s , argued that any health plan should offer universal coverage . `` it is so important that as democrats , we carry the banner of universal health care , '' she said . see where the candidates stand on health care . clinton noted her experience pushing her husband 's plan , saying she 's best suited to hammer out the details of a new plan and create `` a coalition that can withstand the insurance and the prescription drug companies . '' the pair praised former north carolina sen. john edwards , who dropped out of the democratic race this week . both are vying for his supporters . see what the candidates had to say , in their own words '' the democratic race remains close going into super tuesday , when more than 20 states -- including california and new york -- will vote . obama won the season-opening iowa caucuses , then finished second to clinton in every contest until last week 's south carolina primary -- which he won with a commanding 55 percent of the vote in a three-way race . clinton scored victories in the new hampshire primary and nevada caucuses . she also was the top vote-getter in florida and michigan , although no democrats campaigned in those states and their delegates to the nominating convention will not count because of a squabble between state and national party leaders over the timing of the primaries . thursday 's debate differed from the last time the two took to a stage together -- at a contentious january 21 debate in south carolina in which the front-runners peppered each other with sharp attacks . in contrast , on thursday the two smiled , laughed at each other 's jokes and repeatedly complimented the other when they agreed . what does the debate 's cordial tone mean ? '' obama got laughs when asked about how he might counter republican charges against `` tax-and-spend liberal democrats . '' `` well , first of all , i do n't think the republicans are going to be in a real strong position to argue fiscal responsibility , when they have added $ 4 trillion or $ 5 trillion worth of national debt . i am happy to have that argument , '' he said . clinton drew cheers when she responded to a question about how a clinton could promote change after decades of a clinton or bush in power . `` it did take a clinton to clean up after the first bush , and i think it might take another one to clean up after the second bush , '' she said . watch clinton make a jab at bush '' the longest and loudest applause line of the night came when cnn 's wolf blitzer noted that many democrats have said they 'd like to see a clinton-obama or obama-clinton ticket in november . neither ruled out the possibility of selecting the other as a running mate . watch the rivals discuss joining forces '' `` the debate was a rallying debate for democrats , '' said cnn senior political analyst bill schneider . `` democrats like both of them , they continue to like both of them , and they want to vote for both of them . '' schneider said the cordial tone probably helped both candidates . obama continued momentum from his victory in the south carolina primary and high-profile endorsements , including sen. ted kennedy and kansas gov. kathleen sebelius . clinton probably maintained her perceived status as the front-runner . `` i 'm not sure that he turned the election around , '' schneider said . `` he is the challenger here -- he 's got to persuade people they do n't want to vote for her . '' the debate , sponsored by cnn , the los angeles times and politico.com , was held at los angeles ' kodak theatre , where the academy awards are handed out . hundreds , if not thousands , of clinton and obama supporters thronged outside the venue -- cheering and waving signs . the numerous actors , directors and musicians in the audience included stevie wonder , pierce brosnan , rob reiner , jason alexander , isaiah washington , diane keaton , leonardo dicaprio , quentin tarantino and christina applegate . mike gravel , the other democratic presidential candidate still in the race , was not invited to participate in the debate because he did not meet certain criteria , including support in national polls . in a cnn/opinion research corporation poll conducted january 14-17 , gravel received less than 1 percent . e-mail to a friend .

'' further discussions regarding those two countries is to resume thursday , he said . u.s. president george w. bush has pushed for the admission of ukraine and georgia to the military alliance . however , russia -- which is not a nato member -- has expressed concerns about the former soviet republics joining nato , which has already made members of other former soviet countries latvia , lithuania , and estonia . appathurai also said a general consensus could not be reached on macedonia 's bid , because of greece 's objections . greece has threatened to veto macedonia 's bid if its northern neighbor does not agree to change its name . athens has long argued that the name macedonia implies territorial claims on its northern province of the same name -- the birthplace , also , of greece 's most revered ancient warrior , alexander the great . the name issue must be resolved by the two countries , appathurai said . e-mail to a friend .
663	san diego , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- in a recent commentary , i wrote that , as a mexican-american , the ugliness of the immigration debate offends me -- not as a mexican , but as an american . ruben navarrette jr. lists 10 things u.s.-born hispanics find distasteful about the immigration debate . a woman wrote in and asked me to be more specific : just what was it about the immigration debate that was so ugly ? she came to the right place . after nearly 20 years of writing opinions and insisting that i do n't speak for all hispanics , in recent months , i 've heard from hundreds of hispanics who -- appreciative of my middle-ground approach to the immigration issue -- insist that i can speak for them anytime . so , with the authority vested in me , i 'll now share some of what other hispanics are saying . it 's not far off from what janet murguia had to say . as president of the national council of la raza , the largest hispanic civil rights organization in the united states , murguia recently delivered an important speech to the national press club . the topic : the immigration debate and what she called a wave of hate sweeping the land -- one that is n't limited to illegal immigrants , but which is now affecting all hispanics regardless of where they were born , what language they speak or what flag they salute . the way murguia sees it , immigration is `` on the verge of becoming one of the largest civil rights issues of our generation . '' and , hispanics are playing the piñata . murguia was right on the button . to borrow a phrase , it 's getting ugly out there . and u.s.-born hispanics see it as plain as day . here are 10 things they find distasteful about this debate : . • the hypocrisy . we have two signs on the u.s.-mexican border : `` keep out '' and `` help wanted . '' • the racism . with lightning speed , the debate went from anti-illegal immigrant to anti-immigrant to anti-mexican . • the opportunism . too many politicians are trying too hard to portray themselves as tough on illegal immigration . • the simple solutions . `` build a wall . '' `` deport all illegals . '' a quick rule of thumb : if it fits on a bumper sticker , it 's not a workable policy . • the naiveté . people ask why mexico wo n't help stop illegal immigration . hint : last year , mexicans in the united states sent home $ 25 billion . • the profiling . dark skin and spanish surnames should n't be proxies for undocumented status . been to arizona lately ? • the meanness . nazi-produced internet video games let players shoot illegal immigrants crossing the border . fun stuff . • the amnesia . americans think grandpa was welcomed with open arms and that he plunged into the melting pot . whatever . • the buck-passing . americans love to blame mexico for their choices , yelling across the border : `` stop us before we hire again . '' • the double standard . the same folks who have zero tolerance for illegal immigrants easily tolerate those who hire them . some of this is painfully familiar , recalling earlier versions of this debate as it played out a hundred or two hundred years ago . hispanics are the new germans , the new irish , the new italians . but it 's also ugly . it was then . it is now . ruben navarrette jr. is a member of the editorial board of the san diego union-tribune and a nationally syndicated columnist . read his column here . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer . e-mail to a friend .

's ambitions to join in on this growth . cnn 's john defterios -lrb- jd -rrb- sits down with shaukat aziz -lrb- sa -rrb- , former prime minister to pakistan to talk about the emerging relationship . former pakistani prime minister shaukat aziz . aziz is an expert in global banking who worked in the middle east for a number of years as an official for citigroup . he was an influential player in the process of creating a free trade agreement between pakistan and china , after visiting the country in 2005 . shaukat aziz talks about the growing ties between china and the middle east , and gives us inside knowledge on doing business in china . -lrb- sa -rrb- : i think the two economies are complementary . china is a global economy which is growing rapidly . it has one of the highest growth rates in the world , and it is expanding its footprint all over the world . dubai and the u.a.e. is clearly a hub for south asia , the middle east , and the whole region . they are a trading center , they are a financial center , and they do n't compete directly with china , in fact both economies will compliment each other . i think the u.a.e. prime minister 's trip will help to further reinforce this and get the two countries closer together , in trade , in financial flows , in linking capital markets and many other initiatives . -lrb- jd -rrb- : trade has been growing 30 to 40 percent over the last four years . but can it move beyond hard chinese goods going into the gulf ? -lrb- sa -rrb- : of course it can . i think the nature of dubai is such that it has now become the clearing house for goods from all over the world . and buyers go to dubai and look for the best product at the best price . so , if china , being a large country , can bring its products to dubai , it will help both countries . may i also say that i see china evolving as an exporter of capital , not just goods because china is running huge surpluses . their reserves are at an all time high . so they are looking for investments too , and you see now a trend in chinese companies to buy companies overseas . a trend in chinese companies to invest overseas because they want , once they go global , they want production facilities all over the world . so the design and the research and development will be done in china , the components will come from china , but the manufacturing could move across the world . this trend is already started and i think this will all go well for both countries . -lrb- jd -rrb- : lets take it a step further . do you see chinese investment funds or sovereign funds and u.a.e. sovereign funds going out together to acquire companies in the near future ? -lrb- sa -rrb- : sure , there have been situations where both have participated in different companies . -lrb- jd -rrb- : but separately . -lrb- sa -rrb- : separately , but i think they could join too . but the real issue on sovereign funds is being represented in certain quarters as if this is something which is unhelpful to the global economy . in my view , in an era of globalization we must open up our markets for investments and let anybody come along in line with the rules of that country . may i say that the sovereignty of any country is a very robust concept . and if a foreign sovereign fund or investor comes along and buys a bank in a particular country , the countries sovereignty is never jeopardized . but , if you have good regulators and good policies , because even in a deregulated environment , regulation is necessary . deregulation does not mean abdication by the government , so if your regulatory regime is sound , you do n't have to worry . sovereign funds have demonstrated that they have helped promote economic activity , help save certain companies , banks as a case in point . and it 's a win-win for both sides . so i think this question of their role is over stated . -lrb- jd -rrb- : saudi arabia 's king abdullah went to visit china when he came into power in early 2006 . is itinevitable that u.s.-european allies in the gulf turn to the east now and look for new partnerships in an east-east equation ? -lrb- sa -rrb- : this is the fastest growing economy in the world . it is absorbing foreign investment , it is exporting investment . it is the largest producer of goods and services now , in terms of growth rate . so saudi arabia , naturally , the largest economy in the middle east by a long margin , needs to link up a country like china . i think it is not geo-politics which is driving it . it is economic necessity . it is tapping into growth . saudi companies are investing in china . i know that in the energy sector aramco has gone in for joint ventures and maybe sabic too , and that is to me a very positive development . because it is showing that capital looks for opportunities and if there is return china is not far enough . e-mail to a friend .

670	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- responding to recent accidents linked to pilot fatigue , federal safety officials hope reduce airline pilots ' logging 14-hour days . the faa currently allows pilots to log 14-hour workdays , which the ntsb says contributes to accidents . the national transportation safety board concluded in a report out tuesday that pilot fatigue was a probable cause in a runway landing accident during bad weather in michigan last winter . there were no fatalities . the federal aviation administration currently allows a 14-hour workday with eight hours of logged airtime . `` it 's a critical issue ; it 's an insidious issue . many times , the pilots themselves do n't even recognize that they are fatigued when they get into that cockpit , '' ntsb chairman mark rosenker said . and rosenker made the same points about air traffic controllers more than a year ago , in april 2007 . in a letter to the faa , rosenker said that four other plane incidents `` provide clear and compelling evidence '' that controllers are sometimes operating while fatigued because of their work schedules and poor use of rest periods . `` that fatigue has contributed to controller errors , '' rosenker wrote in 2007 . `` fourteen hours is still a very long day , '' ntsb board member debbie hersman said . her conclusion is backed by 40 years of airline accident statistics compiled by the faa and cited tuesday at an ntsb hearing . `` after a duty period of about 10 to 12 hours , the number of observed accidents increased exponentially , '' ntsb staff member malcolm brenner said . in february , the cockpit crew of a passenger plane operated by mesa airlines failed to answer air traffic controllers for 18 minutes , missed the flight 's destination in hawaii and continued for another 15 miles at 21,000 feet over the pacific ocean . the investigation has shown that `` both pilots unintentionally fell asleep during cruise flight , '' ntsb staff member jena price said during a presentation to the safety board . the crew of go ! flight 1002 eventually answered concerned calls on the radio from ground controllers , turned around and safely landed . the ntsb report called for analysis of sleep quantity , sleep quality , performance , errors and incidents traced to schedules that disrupt sleep patterns , perhaps while stretching workloads to the maximum allowed . `` they can not just keep pushing pilots until they drop , '' said the head of the air line pilots association , rory kay . he said during a break in the ntsb hearing that `` pilot pushing '' is an issue . `` we are in tough economic times , we 're being asked to do more with less , and we have to support the pilot when he makes the determination that it 's time to call it quits , '' he said . after reviewing some possible remedies against fatigue in the cockpit , board members unanimously approved the proposal to the faa , which would be responsible for developing guidance for the airlines to carry out . the faa plans to hold a symposium on fatigue management next week with representatives from the aviation industry . `` i want the faa to have a complete overhaul of the flight time/duty time regulations '' that presently allow a 14-hour day with eight hours of flight time , kay said .
671	los angeles -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the man whose investigation of president clinton provided reams of tabloid fodder is now working to help crack down on photographers working for the very publications his efforts once filled . photographers surround singer britney spears ' car in los angeles , california , in october . kenneth starr -- the independent counsel whose open-ended investigation of a clinton land deal veered into an intimately detailed report on the president 's affair with intern monica lewinsky -- is helping california lawmakers craft laws to crack down on celebrity-hunting packs of paparazzi . malibu mayor pamela conley ulich contacted starr , now a law school dean at pepperdine university in malibu . local governments in los angeles and west hollywood are also part of the effort to curb what they call a dangerous and expensive problem . `` just imagine you 're a motorist driving down the street and britney spears parks next to you ; all of a sudden you 're swarmed by these people , '' los angeles city councilman dennis zine said . `` they 've got cameras ; they 're jumping on the hood of my car . `` you do n't know if you 're getting carjacked . you do n't know what 's happening . '' the idea of a `` safe zone '' around celebrities has been kicked around by l.a.-area lawmakers for years . the push became more intense in the wake of multiple mob scenes around pop star spears last year , including a virtual siege of her studio city , california , home and similar scenes during her trips to hospitals . starr has been in contact with the officials but is `` not ready to publicly comment '' on any plan he may have , according to a pepperdine spokesperson . lawmakers have set no timetable for when they 'd like to have laws drafted . police chief william j. bratton has argued that there 's no need for new laws to deal with the problem . but zine and others argue that police resources are stretched thin by the current state of things , citing $ 25,000 shelled out last year for a police escort for spears . to some , starr -- the man vilified by liberals for a lengthy and costly clinton investigation that turned up clinton 's personal foibles but no major wrongdoing in the whitewater land deals -- seems an odd partner for politicians in the notoriously left-leaning los angeles area . `` the irony is that he was so criticized , so vilified by hollywood liberals 10 years ago during the monica lewinsky impeachment saga , '' said david mark , a senior editor at politico . `` now he 's kind of aligned himself with a lot of malibu residents who probably disagree with him politically . '' but zine , who has been a prime backer of laws curbing the `` pap packs , '' said starr 's expertise will be valuable as lawmakers try to strike a balance between public safety and first amendment freedom of the press concerns . `` i have a lot of respect for ken starr , '' zine said . `` we do n't want to violate any rules . we do n't want to violate the constitution . `` we believe that the constitution needs to be upheld -lsb- but -rsb- at the same time , we need to protect our celebrities .

'' by 6 p.m. floodwaters in kingfisher had begun to subside , but the storm system had not yet exited the state , ooten said . flood warnings were issued until midnight for parts of eastern oklahoma , she said . the helicopter rescue operation got under way sunday morning , after authorities got a call alerting them that a pickup truck containing two passengers had been swept from a bridge over kingfisher creek , west said . first , a helicopter dropped life vests to the couple , whose pickup truck was nearly obscured by the water . soon afterward , their truck was simply swept away , and the pair were left to fend for themselves in the water until the rescue helicopter approached . first , a rescuer grabbed the woman and pulled her toward the skid on which he was positioned . for a few seconds , she held on as the helicopter rose , but lost her grip and fell back into the water . the helicopter circled back for a second effort , which this time proved successful . the drama from the town of about 14,000 residents 35 miles northwest of oklahoma city unfolded live on national television . `` when the lady fell , i was kind of surprised , i hated to see that , '' said west , who watched the rescue on television . `` we were able to get back around , get her picked up . '' like his partner , the man also fell , was picked up again and taken to safety . the rescue work then focused on removing people stranded atop the roofs of vehicles and buildings . time and again , the pilots positioned their helicopters inches above choppy water as rescuers helped men and women grab the skids . residents of nearby apache , oklahoma , faced similar floods , which caught most people off guard , said lt. bobby claborne of the apache fire department . `` we never thought we 'd have a tropical storm in our area , '' he said . no evacuation plans were initiated until early sunday , `` but it was a little late '' by then , he said . for several hours , thousands of people were without power in el reno , which had been inundated by more than six inches of rain in just a few hours . and some vehicles were trapped on interstate 40 in western oklahoma , said capt. ken brown , the state police operations commander in el reno . `` two different semis were overcome by water and required fire rescue to get the drivers from their vehicles , '' he said . boats and other watercraft were enlisted in the rescue effort . west said the flooded areas have sustained extensive damage -- `` not only to homes and businesses and automobiles , but to these agricultural areas . '' `` we have a lot of roadways that will be damaged from this , '' he said . `` there 's going to be a lot of debris that floated in . and you know , road crews are going to have to get out and clear those .

673	colorado springs , colorado -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- president bush told the 2008 graduating class at the u.s. air force academy on wednesday that the `` only way america could lose the war on terror is if we defeat ourselves . '' president bush and air force academy graduate michael riddick of aiken , south carolina , celebrate graduation . speaking on a cloudy day at falcon stadium , the president compared the wars in iraq and afghanistan to america 's earlier conflicts , particularly world war ii . `` our nation is once again contending with an ideology that seeks to sow anger , hatred and despair : the ideology of islamic extremism , '' he said . `` in today 's struggle , we are once again facing evil men who despise freedom and despise america and aim to subject millions to their violent rule . `` we assumed this obligation before , '' he said , referring to the rebuilding of germany and japan after world war ii , a conflict that saw the loss of more than 400,000 american lives . watch more of bush 's speech '' `` germany and japan , once mortal enemies , are now allies of the united states . and people across the world have reaped the benefits from that alliance , '' he said . `` today , we must do the same in afghanistan and iraq . ... we 'll lay the foundation of peace for generations to come . '' but today 's wars differ from those of the past , bush acknowledged , and not only because of modern technology that allows `` greater precision '' in warfare . `` one challenge is that in the past , in germany and japan , the work of rebuilding took place in relative quiet , '' he said . `` today , we 're helping emerging democracies rebuild under fire from terrorist networks and state sponsors of terror . this is a difficult and unprecedented task -- and we 're learning as we go . '' the measure of success in war has changed , he said . `` in the past ... there were public surrenders , a signing ceremony on the deck of a battleship , victory parades in american cities . today , when the war continues after the regime has fallen , the definition of success is more complicated . '' nonetheless , he said , in iraq and afghanistan , there is a clear definition of success : when those countries are rid of al qaeda , when they are economically viable , when they are democracies that can govern effectively and when they are strong allies on the war on terror . `` these successes will come , '' he told the class . `` and when they do , our nation will have achieved victory , and the american people will be more secure .

675	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- bangladesh police have detained or arrested more than 18,000 people in the last 11 days in a crackdown on crime they say is aimed at improving security ahead of december elections . people arrested by bangladesh police in their latest round-up arrive at a jail in dhaka . human rights groups decry the actions as politically motivated . the round-ups began may 28 , days after the two main political parties said they would not cooperate with the military-backed caretaker government on organizing the elections . police told cnn that by saturday 16,916 arrests had been made , while local media reported another 1,548 were arrested sunday . the awami league and the bangladesh nationalist party -lrb- bnp -rrb- said hundreds of their party members had been taken into custody . `` the timing and targets of the arrests are a dead giveaway they are politically motivated , '' brad adams of the new york-based human rights watch said in a statement . `` it 's obvious that they are paying the price for the political parties ' refusal to accept the government 's conditions to participate in the elections . '' the government rejects the allegations . the detentions , it said , are part of a planned sweep to rid the country of criminals . `` our igp -lsb- inspector general of police , or chief of police -rsb- categorically said this special drive was being conducted to create a congenial atmosphere before the general election , '' said kamrul ahsan , a spokesman for bangladesh police . `` it is not politically motivated , '' he said . `` the intention is not to harass anybody politically . '' the crackdown began after the awami league and the bnp said they would not cooperate with the government to develop a roadmap toward democracy unless it first releases the parties ' leaders . the two women who head the parties -- sheikh hasina of the awami league and khaleda zia of the bnp -- are in police custody on corruption-related charges . hasina is charged with bribe-taking . zia is being held on charges of graft for improperly awarding a multi-million dollar government contract . the current political crisis in the muslim-majority south asian country of 150 million can be traced , in large part , to the lingering animosity between the two women , political observers say . their rivalry runs so deep that the women are known in the country as the `` battling begums . '' begum is an honorific given to women of rank in the country . since the country 's independence in 1972 , the awami league or the bnp has ruled bangladesh for all but eight years . both women have served as prime minister at one point or another . after its last stint in power ended in 2006 , the bnp handed over rule to a caretaker government to conduct elections , as mandated by the country 's constitution . but the awami league refused to recognize the neutrality of the interim government . hasina accused zia of stocking it with bnp backers . supporters and party members took to the streets in months of deadly clashes . to stem the tide of violence , a military-backed government took control in january 2007 and imposed an indefinite state of emergency . it also postponed elections until it said it could clean up the country 's graft-ridden politics . the caretaker government adopted the emergency powers rules . the rules allowed authorities to arrest people without a warrant as long as there was reasonable suspicion that he or she was connected to a crime , human rights watch said . a wave of detentions followed . by some estimates more than 90,000 people were detained before some were released and others charged with crimes . among those arrested were more than 150 top politicians , including hasina and zia -- leading to the current political stalemate . the government wants to hold elections in the third week of december , and said the crusade on crime is part of its plan to ensure trouble-free balloting . the political parties allege the arrests are intended to pave the way for the election of pro-government candidates . they want their leaders set free before they sit down and talk with the government about a roadmap toward a successful election . they also threatened to organize mass movements to secure their leaders ' release . `` it 's kind of an impasse , '' said taleya rehman , founder and executive director of the bangladesh-based non-profit democracy watch . `` the government is conducting political dialogue with small parties . but they are of no significance . they need the two major parties . '' on monday , the government announced it was releasing hasina from custody on medical grounds so she can go abroad for treatment . a similar release for zia was also expected . party members say the government 's move is a ploy to sideline the pair from the elections by sending them out of the country . hasina has a damaged ear resulting from a bombing attack that targeted her four years ago . zia is believed to have arthritis . meanwhile , the detentions continue -- almost 1,800 a day . in addition to political party members , the crackdown has also swept up several journalists . `` that actually makes the arrests suspicious in some people 's minds , '' said sultana kamal , executive director of the legal aid group , ain o salish kendro -lrb- law and adjudication center -rrb- . `` if you just arrest any tom , dick and harry saying this person may have arms , then people will legitimately raise questions about the mode of the whole operation .

676	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- the legend of jack daniel reaches all the way back to the moment he was born . unfortunately , nobody knows exactly when that was . jack daniel believed the more memorable his image , the more memorable his whiskey . some records show that jasper newton `` jack '' daniel came into the world on september 5 , 1846 . his tombstone , however , says 1850 . strange , because his mother died in 1847 . all of this might not normally matter , but jack 's birth date is important to his overall legend , which proudly proclaims him `` the boy distiller . '' so perhaps it 's best we begin when jack was first introduced to whiskey , which we know was early in life . leaving home at a young age , jack struck out on his own with nothing more than a handful of items valued at $ 9 . he ended up at the home of dan call , a preacher at a nearby lutheran church and the owner of a general store . there , reverend call also happened to sell whiskey that he distilled himself . jack quickly became determined to learn the craft . in fact , many storytellers claim the boy wonder bought the still from call and began pursuing the business full-time at the ripe age of 16 . if that legend is true , then jack began selling his own tennessee whiskey only three years later ; the famous black labels on the company bottles proudly pronounce , `` established and registered in 1866 . '' in reality , no documents support that myth . jack may have been a teenage moonshiner , but he did n't register his business with the federal government until 1875 . and by then , jack would have been the more booze-appropriate age of 29 . the maker makes his mark . whatever legends exist , one thing is certain : jack daniel had a brilliant mind for marketing . even as a youngster , jack understood that if people remembered him , they would remember his whiskey . to that end , he decked himself out in a formal knee-length coat , a vest , a tie , and a wide-brim planter 's hat , and was never caught out of `` uniform '' again . jack also established the jack daniel 's silver cornet band -- a 10-member outfit solely devoted to promoting his whiskey across the countryside . with uniforms and instruments from the sears & roebuck catalog and a specially designed wagon for traveling , jack made sure the band played every saloon opening , fourth of july celebration , and political rally around . but perhaps jack 's most brilliant decision concerned how to present his whiskey . from the beginning , jack had been one of the first sellers to stencil his distillery name on his whiskey jugs . next , he upgraded to round , custom-embossed bottles . but when a glass salesman showed him a prototype square bottle in 1895 , jack realized he 'd stumbled upon something unique . the new bottles not only stood out from the crowd , but also had a shape that would prevent them from rolling around and breaking during transport . in addition , the square look reinforced the idea that jack was a square dealer who put honest work and high standards first . whatever effort jack daniel put into his marketing , he never let quality slip . in 1904 , the distiller decided on a whim to enter his whiskey in the taste competition at the st. louis world 's fair . it came as little surprise when he won . lucky no. 7 . perhaps jack 's greatest coup was the name he gave his high-quality product -- old no. 7 . naturally , nobody seems to know why . the official historian at the jack daniel distillery today says it 's the most oft-asked question on factory tours . as you might imagine , many theories have been advanced . jack had seven girlfriends . jack believed the number seven was lucky . jack was honoring a merchant friend who owned seven stores that distributed jack 's liquor . jack misplaced a batch of whiskey for seven years and , upon finding it , labeled it `` old no. 7 . '' none of these stories , however , makes as much sense as the less-than-sexy explanation from jack daniel biographer peter krass . simply put , jack was originally assigned a district tax assessment number of 7 . but when the irs consolidated districts within tennessee , they arbitrarily reassigned him the number 16 . jack did n't want to confuse his loyal consumers , and he certainly did n't want to bend to the government , so he began labeling his bottles `` old no. 7 . '' more than 125 years later , this act of defiance still makes his labels stand out . jack without jill . jack daniel never married . some say it 's because he was married to his work ; others say it 's because he never found a girl who measured up to his high standards . or perhaps it 's just that he was too busy catering to the greater lynchburg population -- throwing elaborate christmas feasts , hosting exquisite costume parties in his second-story ballroom , and donating money to every church in moore county . but by all accounts , jack was quite a ladies ' man . he was a perfect dance partner , a polite conversationalist , and a fantastic gift-giver . unfortunately , he also gravitated toward girls young enough to be his daughter -lrb- or even granddaughter -rrb- . once , jack even asked for a woman 's hand in marriage , but her father denied him -- partly because jack enjoyed keeping his own legend alive and always hesitated to reveal his true birth date . when jack proposed , her father made it clear that any man unwilling to disclose his age was `` a little too old for such a young girl . '' the early bird gets the gangrene . hard as it might be to believe , in the end , the great distiller actually died from getting to work too early . as the story goes , one morning in 1906 , jack arrived at his office before anybody else . he tried to access the company safe , but had a terrible time remembering the code . after a few frustrating minutes , he kicked the safe as hard as he could . he badly bruised his left foot and immediately began to walk with a limp . the limp only grew worse with time , and he later discovered the injury had led to blood poisoning . then came gangrene , then amputation , and then , five years later , death . it 's not the happiest ending for the story , or the clearest cut , but it is the best , because it adds to the mystery and mystique of jack daniel . as they say , where facts can not be found , legends fill the empty space and that 's perfectly fine for the keepers of the company flame . after all , as jack himself believed , the more memorable his image , the more memorable his whiskey . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .

683	editor 's note : cnn.com 's wayne drash writes about his maniacal love for university of memphis basketball . memphis , north carolina , ucla and kansas play in the final four this weekend . drash says the memphis team can help heal the city 's old wounds . cnn.com 's wayne drash , left , says he 's been hooked on university of memphis basketball since he was a kid . atlanta , georgia -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- my love for university of memphis basketball is completely irrational . i never went to school there and have no affiliation with the university . but i bleed tiger blue . my dad used to take my brothers and me to memphis games as a kid , and i 've been hooked ever since . we once bought tickets from a scalper for six bucks apiece against arch-rival the university of louisville in the 1980s . my dad complained we paid too much . but then we moved in seventh grade . i became an even bigger fan after we left the city . i 'd huddle over my am radio , hooked up with a coat hanger wrapped in aluminum foil as an antenna . more than 350 miles away , i managed to pick up the then-memphis state games through the crackle and static of the radio . memphis basketball was my only way to remain connected to my youth and the city that i loved . that was 1985 , the last time memphis made the final four . is your team in the final four ? send your ireport celebratory photos . back then , memphis was led by a phenom named keith lee . he was best known for a sweet baseline jumper as soft as the nylon nets he swished . he was also known for his giant afro . he was listed as 6 feet 10 inches . the joke was if you included his wild hairdo , he was 7-4 . when my parents were away at work , sometimes i 'd sneak into my mom 's cabinet , steal her mousse and then put it in my hair . then this white kid would go out back and shoot hoops for hours , hair sticking straight out like i stuck my finger in a socket . it was the only way i could be like lee , my hero and idol . back then , memphians would rank lee right up there with elvis presley as the city 's most popular icons . many still do . and that 's the thing about tiger basketball . in a place where race has often divided so much of it , memphis basketball has helped unite the city . as a boy , white and black kids would crowd the basketball court at tiger games to try to snatch the players ' sweatbands as they raced into the locker room . up until i graduated from high school , the sweatbands of phillip `` doom '' haynes and baskerville `` batman '' holmes sat on my shelf in my room . like a fan of any team , there have been good and bad times over the years . but sometimes the pain of being a tiger fan is that much greater . tragedy and heartbreak are part of it , such as when holmes killed his girlfriend and then himself in 1997 . other players , such as aaron price and a. maceo battle , have died far too young along the way , furthering the pain of being a fan . larry finch -- who as a black player brought together the city and took memphis to its only national championship game in 1973 , and later became one of its greatest coaches -- has lived much of the past few years in a rehabilitation center after suffering severe strokes . in some ways , that 's what makes memphis basketball so special . memphis players embody the real life of so many americans , many faced with extreme hard times . some succeed ; some do n't . others , such as finch , keep on fighting . i do n't find it an accident that memphis is now seeking history the same week of the 40th anniversary of the assassination of the rev. martin luther king jr. `` i think dr. king would find this a source of joy , '' the rev. jesse jackson told the team this week , according to the memphis commercial appeal newspaper . a city that has seen so much pain , so much heartache , has something huge to celebrate -- all revolving around young college kids and a bouncy orange ball . the adage is that sports often have the ability to transcend the moment . this is one of those times . to get to the championship game monday night , memphis must first get past ucla , the same team that defeated it in that 1973 title game . while much of the rest of the nation has the team pegged to lose , the tigers -- for one shining moment -- have a chance to do something really special . they 'd have it no other way . as for me ? i wo n't be listening on my old radio , but this weekend i might just try sporting that ` do like keith lee . the opinions expressed in this piece are solely those of the writers . e-mail to a friend .
684	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the world 's wildlife has declined by 27 percent since 1970 because of the human impact on the environment , the world wildlife fund said friday . these two adult frilled-neck lizards are threatened species and are bred in captivity in australia . the wwf 's latest living planet index shows terrestrial , freshwater and marine species all suffered declines in their populations between 1970 and 2005 , with freshwater species experiencing the biggest drop . the index is included in a report called `` 2010 and beyond : rising to the biodiversity challenge , '' which the wwf prepared for an international biodiversity conference in germany later this month . `` no one can escape the impact of biodiversity loss because reduced global diversity translates quite clearly into fewer new medicines , greater vulnerability to natural disasters , and greater effects from global warming , '' said james leape , director-general of wwf international . the living planet index measured 4,000 populations of 1,477 vertebrate species , which the wwf says is a good indicator of overall biodiversity trends . terrestrial species in both temperate and tropical areas fell by an average of 25 percent during the 35-year period , the wwf said . marine species fell by 28 percent in the same period , with a dramatic decline between 1995 and 2005 , the wwf said . `` many marine ecosystems are changing rapidly under human influence , and one recent study estimates that more than 40 percent of the world 's ocean area is strongly affected by human activities while few areas remain untouched , '' the wwf report said . freshwater species in both temperate and tropical regions fell by 29 percent between 1970 and 2003 . the wwf said that is especially significant because despite covering only about 1 percent of the total land surface of the planet , inland waters are home to more than 40,000 vertebrate species . in tropical regions , freshwater species were especially hard-hit ; the index shows they suffered a 35-percent drop between 1970 and 2000 . the wwf said it had insufficient data to chart tropical freshwater species beyond 2000 and temperate freshwater species beyond 2003 . the causes of the declines are varied but ultimately stem from human demands on the biosphere , such as consumption of natural resources or the displacement of ecosystems , the wwf said . the dominant threat to marine life is overexploitation -- harvesting or killing animals or plants beyond the species ' capacity to replace itself , the wwf said . overfishing is one example . overexploitation is also a threat to terrestrial species , according to the report , which cites the hunting of tropical forest mammals . overharvesting of timber is also a major factor , it said . invasive species , whether introduced deliberately or not , are another threat , especially in freshwater ecosystems , where they are thought to be the main cause of extinction among endemic species , the wwf said . pollution and overall climate change are other factors causing a loss of biodiversity , it said . the wwf called on governments attending this month 's conference to take urgent action to reduce the rate of loss by 2010 . it wants governments to establish protected areas , particularly those areas important for food security , water supply , medicine , and disaster mitigation , and to commit to zero deforestation by 2020 .
685	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- three protesters scaled the golden gate bridge monday and unfurled a `` free tibet '' banner , a likely precursor to large protests when the olympic torch arrives wednesday in san francisco , california . members of students for a free tibet climbed the bridge to place these banners , said the group 's spokesman . the banner read , `` one world . one dream . free tibet . '' those who climbed cables from which the bridge is suspended are members of students for a free tibet , said group spokesman tenzin dasang . the three were arrested along with four others at the site . all seven were charged with felony conspiracy and misdemeanor nuisance , said california highway patrol officer mary ziegenbein . the climbers also were charged with misdemeanor trespassing . watch protesters and banner hung from bridge '' the incident forced the closure of one northbound lane of the bridge . the climbers -- who were on the bridge for about three hours -- came down voluntarily about 1:15 p.m. -lrb- 4:15 p.m. et -rrb- after workers with the golden gate bridge district began cutting down their banner , ziegenbein said . dasang said he has heard of many people planning to protest in san francisco against china 's human rights record . `` we want it to be peaceful . but it will be large , '' said dasang , 22 , during a phone interview in which he said he was near the bridge . `` i heard from tibetans that now live all over the u.s. and even abroad who are coming here . '' the olympic flame is on a 130-day journey that will take it through 23 cities on five continents and then throughout china , culminating at the olympics opening ceremony in beijing august 8 . the san francisco protest comes the same day as a demonstration in paris , france , disrupted the torch relay many times . in paris , police had to cut the olympic torch relay short monday amid protests against china 's human rights record , french police said . the torch was scheduled to travel 17 miles , past paris city hall , but that stop and others were called off after the protests . the torch made it through about 10 miles of its scheduled journey . it was then driven by bus to its final destination , where it was displayed again during a public ceremony at a stadium . authorities had to play hide-and-seek with the olympic torch during much of the route , placing it on a bus at least twice during a sometimes chaotic relay route . china has come under international criticism because of its crackdown last month on protesters calling for democratic freedoms and self-rule in tibet and neighboring chinese provinces . protesters have said more than 100 people have died in the crackdown , but beijing denies that and has accused supporters of the dalai lama of orchestrating the violence . u.s. and other western leaders have called on china to provide civil rights and freedoms to those in tibet and to enter peaceful discussions aimed at resolving the crisis . e-mail to a friend .
686	madrid , spain -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the search is back on for words to the spanish national anthem . spain 's basketball team : able to hum the national anthem , but not sing words . the lack of lyrics in spain 's anthem has long created awkward moments for winning spanish athletes at the olympics . they stand on the podium silently or hum along while winning athletes from other nations sing when their anthem is played during their moment of triumph . with the summer olympic games fast-approaching , the spanish olympic committee stirred the lyric-writing impulses of spaniards by sponsoring a competition to provide words for the anthem . the contest drew 7,000 entries , and an expert panel selected a winner . the committee announced plans for renowned spanish tenor placido domingo to sing the lyrics on monday . then , suddenly , the committee discarded the winning lyrics . `` once spaniards heard these lyrics , they sparked a lot of controversy , even rejection , '' alejandro blanco , president of the spanish olympic committee , told a packed news conference this week . the now-discarded winning lyrics had begun with , `` viva espana , '' or `` long-live spain , '' and critics complained that phrase harkened back to the right-wing dictatorship of general francisco franco , who led a military uprising in 1936 against the elected government and won a civil war , ruling spain until his death in 1975 . `` you have to consider that many spaniards do n't consider the national anthem as their own . it was played a lot under franco , '' said margarita saenz-diez , a journalist . spain is now a democracy , but many still bristle at the military march that 's served for more than two centuries as the national anthem . spain is made up of many different peoples , and five languages are spoken across the country . the catalans in the northeast and the basques in the north already have their own national songs with lyrics . getting agreement on any lyrics to the national anthem is no easy task and would ultimately have to be approved by parliament . the president of the spanish olympic committee conceded he does n't know when there will be lyrics for the anthem , and many here say there is n't enough time to get lyrics approved before the aug. 8 start of the summer olympic games in beijing . yet the search goes on . `` we will continue with the idea of an anthem with lyrics , '' blanco said . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's al goodman contributed to this report .

688	jerusalem -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the u.n. security council failed to reach a consensus when it met to consider condemning an attack that killed eight people at a prominent jewish seminary as an act of terrorism . ambulance workers put one of the casualties from the seminary attack into an ambulance . the council said libya -- a new , nonpermanent member -- blocked the statement on thursday night . ibrahim dabbashi , libya 's deputy ambassador to the united nations , said the attack on the school was no different than israeli military offensives against militants in gaza . but dan gillerman , israel 's ambassador to the united nations , said he saw no connection between thursday 's shooting and israel 's operations in gaza . `` this is not a story of retaliation , '' he said . `` these people have been terrorizing israel for years , have been carrying out suicide bombings and indiscriminate attacks for years . '' a gunman broke into the jewish seminary about 8:30 p.m. , spraying automatic-weapons fire , authorities said . most of the victims were students in their teens and 20s , medical officials said . at least nine others were wounded before an off-duty israel defense forces officer fatally shot the gunman , jerusalem district police commander aharon franko said . the gunman was carrying an ak-47 and a pistol -- and had time to swap weapons during the massacre . police are trying to identify the gunman and figure out how he managed , while drawing little notice , to enter the large three-story school in a bustling residential neighborhood . `` there was no alert or warning about this attack , '' franko said . watch the immediate aftermath of the attack '' a first responder said the bodies were on the floor of the study hall surrounded by holy books . no group has claimed responsibility for the attack . video from thursday 's scene showed a frantic crowd of rescue workers carrying bloodied victims into ambulances . dozens of police officers were scouring the campus and streets around the yeshiva in case there were other gunmen . outside the school , scores of israeli men gathered from surrounding neighborhoods , demanding justice for the attack . authorities are calling the incident at west jerusalem 's merkaz harav yeshiva an act of terrorism . the school is one of the largest seminaries in israel , with about 500 students in the yeshiva and 200 in an advanced graduate program . `` israel is at the forefront of the struggle against terrorism and will continue to defend its citizens , who are exposed to this threat on a daily basis , '' israel 's foreign ministry said in a written statement . `` israel expects the nations of the world to support it in its war against those who murder students , women and children , by any means and with respect for neither place nor target . '' president bush backed israeli leaders in a statement issued thursday , saying , `` i condemn in the strongest possible terms the terrorist attack in jerusalem that targeted innocent students at the merkaz harav yeshiva . this barbaric and vicious attack on innocent civilians deserves the condemnation of every nation . '' but libya 's dabbashi compared the attack with `` bloodshed in the palestinian territory . '' `` for us , the human lives are the same . we judge the incident itself , '' dabbashi told reporters after the security council meeting . `` when we have to condemn the killing of the israeli civilians , we also have to look at what 's happening in gaza . '' jerusalem security increased . security was bolstered , with thousands of additional officers across jerusalem and the rest of israel , authorities said . meanwhile , celebratory shooting took place in gaza city after the news of the attack , with hundreds chanting and clapping in the streets . but palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas criticized the killings . `` the palestinian authority condemns any attack on innocent civilians , '' abbas ' office said in a written statement . the shootings came just a day after u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice , who met with both israelis and palestinians , announced that peace talks will resume between the two sides . abbas suspended peace negotiations last week after fierce fighting broke out between israel and palestinian militants in gaza , but he agreed to resume negotiations after meeting with rice . israel will continue peace talks with the palestinians regardless of the attack in jerusalem , foreign ministry spokesman aryeh mekel said thursday . israel conducted a large-scale operation in gaza to hunt down palestinian militants who have been firing dozens of rockets into israel . at least 70 palestinians and two israeli soldiers were killed during the operation , israeli and palestinian sources said . militants also fired at least 25 rockets toward israel , wounding at least two civilians . `` this operation came directly after the attack committed inside gaza . this operation is a normal response , '' said fawzi barhoom , a hamas spokesman in gaza . watch barhoom 's reaction to the attack '' gillerman said the security council should condemn the attack . `` they are so , so quick sometimes to criticize israel for defending itself . i would like to see those members convene as we speak in order to condemn this in the strongest possible terms . '' thursday 's attack was the worst inside israel since april 17 , 2006 , when a suicide bombing outside a falafel restaurant in tel aviv killed nine people . islamic jihad claimed responsibility for that attack . attacks in jerusalem are rare . eight people were wounded august 10 in the old city when a palestinian resident grabbed a security guard 's gun and fired ; and four israeli security guards were wounded may 26 when two palestinian gunmen began firing in east jerusalem . all three of the assailants were killed . e-mail to a friend . cnn 's ben wedeman and atika shubert contributed to this report .
689	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- on march 30 the open skies treaty went into effect , liberalizing air travel between the u.s. and europe . but how will the ease of restrictions on transatlantic routes affect business travelers ? under open skies , european and u.s. airlines will be given unlimited access between europe and u.s. points . the treaty puts an end to the exclusive arrangement granted to british airways , virgin atlantic , united airlines and american airlines to fly transatlantic out of london heathrow . but with the airport currently operating at almost-maximum capacity , new flights will be severely limited . as a result competition is fierce for heathrow slots , with airlines paying as much as $ 60 million to get their hands on them . for each flight that is added , another less lucrative service is scrapped . airlines are giving priority to high-yield business routes to and from heathrow . while european carriers are now allowed to fly from any point within e.u across the atlantic , the u.s. domestic market remains closed to them . operators in europe hope that a second phase of the open skies deal will mean a relaxation of restrictions on european airlines ' investment in u.s. carriers and the ability for european airlines to compete in the u.s. domestic market . the issue is pending in u.s. congress . if the u.s. does n't deliver , there is a clause in the agreement that states the open skies treaty -- phase i included -- can be torn up . industry experts foresee some fare wars in both economy and business-class . service options are also likely to improve as competition intensifies . u.s. airlines will vie with ba , the dominant carrier at heathrow , that currently has flights to 24 u.s. cities . the biggest challenge to the incumbent airlines operating out of heathrow will come from carriers in the skyteam alliance , that includes air france and klm , delta air lines , northwest airlines news , and continental airlines . before open skies , the skyteam alliance offered no transatlantic routes to and from heathrow . by summer they will offer 10 percent of these flights . skyteam carriers will be located for the first time in terminal 4 . given the size of the market for u.s.-london flights , airlines will continue to offer services from gatwick , london 's second-busiest airport . open skies will intensify competition for ailing u.s. airlines on what has been their most profitable route . analysts expect to see consolidation between u.s. airlines as they combine international networks to beat competition . one advantage u.s. airlines can offer is opportunity for connecting flights to other european cities as well as on to asia and the mideast . european carriers on the other hand , can not operate domestic flights within the u.s. new flights and new airlines . oneworld alliance . british airways will shift its dallas and houston services from gatwick to heathrow and its warsaw operation to gatwick . flights to detroit and harare will be axed . in june , the airline will also launch services between continental europe and new york . operated by subsidiary openskies , the daily flights will fly from either jfk or newark to brussels or paris cdg using boeing 757s from its existing fleet . in the future , openskies plans to fly to other business centers , including amsterdam , frankfurt , milan , madrid , zurich , and geneva . ba will also commence business-only flights between new york and london city airport next year using airbus a318 jets in a 32-seat layout . skyteam airline alliance 's new transatlantic flights starting between march 30 and june 2008 . • air france in joint venture with delta : daily service to los angeles • continental : twice-daily service to houston and twice-daily service to newark liberty international -lrb- ewr -rrb- from may 29 2008 • delta in joint venture with air france : daily service to atlanta and twice-daily service to new york jfk • northwest in joint venture with klm : daily service to detroit , daily service to minneapolis and daily service to seattle . slots were secured as a result of air france ditching four daily rotations from london to paris charles de gaulle and klm dropping three of its slots to northwest from eindhoven and rotterdam . non-aligned airlines . aer lingus launched services from dublin to washington dc , orlando and san francisco last year . this followed agreement between the irish and u.s. governments that the airline could begin operations before others . low-cost airline ryanair is considering setting up a separate long-haul carrier that would fly ultra-low-fares between secondary airports in europe and u.s. such as stansted and baltimore-washington international . virgin atlantic has decided to wait to see if open skies phase ii is adopted before starting new flights to new york from non-uk cities . e-mail to a friend .
690	sydney , australia -- eamon sullivan regained the 50-meter freestyle world record with a 21.41 seconds swim at the australian olympic trials in sydney . sullivan had lost his 50m freestyle record to frenchman alain bernard four days ago . he took the record back from frenchman alain bernard , who recorded 21.50 seconds at the european championships four days ago . sullivan had held the record with 21.56 , set in sydney in february . after missing out on bernard 's 100m record late on wednesday , sullivan said he hoped to improve his 50m time in friday 's final . `` i came in a bit more relaxed tonight , having got the 100m final out of the way last night and getting into the team for beijing . `` it 's sweet to get the record back off alain after missing out on the 100m world record last night and after he broke the 50m record so quickly after i did it . `` i know i have another swim left so there 's always another chance . i hope i can go faster in the final , but i like to think i can take a couple of a hundredths of a second leading into a final , so we 'll see . '' sullivan missed bernard 's 100m world record by just two-hundredths of a second in qualifying in 47.52 seconds for the olympics . libby trickett broke the women 's 100m freestyle world record with a 52.88 seconds swim . trickett , formerly libby lenton and competing for the first time under her married name , beat the 53.30 mark set by germany 's britta steffen in budapest on august 2 , 2006 . it is the second time trickett has broken the 53-second barrier , but her previous time of 52.99 at the duel in the pool in sydney last year was not ratified by fina because she was swimming against american superstar michael phelps . `` i ca n't tell you how much i wanted to break that record ever since doing it in the duel in the pool in april last year . i just wanted it so badly , '' trickett said . `` to see it officially up there on the scoreboard is just amazing . all my events are very important to me , but the 100m freestyle holds a special place in my heart and to know that four years ago i was going 0.8 seconds off , that is just awesome .

691	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- at least three tornadoes caused massive damage in virginia and injured more than 200 people on monday , officials said . this suffolk , virginia , house was destroyed by an apparent tornado monday . at least 200 were injured in suffolk where a twister destroyed several homes and businesses , said bob spieldenner of the virginia department of emergency management . the storm hit the 138-bed sentara obici hospital , though spieldenner said the facility was still operational and accepting patients . a second tornado struck colonial heights -- about 60 miles northwest , near richmond -- injuring at least 18 people , he said . a third twister damaged several homes near lawrenceville , about 70 miles south of richmond , said bryan jackson , a meteorologist with the national weather service , which confirmed all three tornadoes . gov. tim kaine declared a virginia-wide state of emergency as hazardous weather continued through the central part of the state . the suffolk twister touched down just before 4 p.m. et and plowed its way east into norfolk , damaging scores of homes , stores and cars and downing dozens of trees and power lines , jackson said . watch as a witness describes the tornado form '' video footage from the scene showed roofs torn off homes , cars flipped over , trees snapped in two and a caved-in section of a newly constructed shopping center . furniture , fences and mounds of other debris were tossed in streets , parking lots and lawns . watch the storm 's massive destruction from the air '' a tornado warning over the area remained in effect monday evening . jeff judkins , the city 's emergency management coordinator , said there also were reports of people trapped inside cars . it 's the worst damage he 's seen in the area , he said . an emergency shelter will be established by monday night , suffolk spokeswoman dana woodson said . officials initially reported a fatality , but later determined that it was unrelated to the storm , she said . e-mail to a friend .
692	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- in the words of vice president john nance garner , the vice presidency `` is n't worth a pitcher of warm piss . '' vice president aaron burr is best known for shooting and killing alexander hamilton in a duel in 1804 . that may be true , but the characters who 've held the job are definitely worth a few good pages of trivia . join mental_floss in toasting seven backup plans that made this country great . 1 . chester arthur : james garfield 's v.p. chester arthur took office under the thickest cloud of suspicion . as a lieutenant in senator roscoe conkling 's political machine , arthur held one of the most lucrative positions in government : collector for the port of new york . for seven years , arthur raked in approximately $ 40,000 annually -lrb- about $ 700,000 today -rrb- , running a corrupt spoils system for thousands of payroll employees . with so much money and power , arthur developed an affinity for fancy clothes and earned the nickname `` the gentleman boss . '' but his luck did n't last . president rutherford hayes eventually stepped in and fired him from the post . even with the kickback scandal and claims that he 'd been born in canada -lrb- which should 've disqualified him for the vice presidency -rrb- , arthur still managed to get elected on james garfield 's 1880 ticket . after garfield passed away 199 days into his presidency , arthur did n't hesitate to sign the pendleton civil service reform act . much to the chagrin of conkling , the act revamped civil service by effectively killing the same patronage system that made arthur very , very rich . in cleaning up civil service , arthur also cleaned up his reputation , and he exited the white house a hero . 2 . henry wallace : franklin roosevelt 's second v.p. henry wallace was a dedicated devotee of eastern mysticism . while serving as u.s. secretary of agriculture in the 1930s , he allegedly sent his guru to mongolia under the pretense of collecting grasses that could withstand drought . in reality , wallace was diverting funds to help his guru hunt for evidence that christ had visited asia . but it was n't wallace 's spiritual beliefs that landed him america 's no. 2 job . wallace was a big franklin roosevelt fan and supported his entire platform , which is why roosevelt handpicked him as his third-term running mate in 1940 . wallace was n't popular with the democratic party , but when roosevelt made it clear he would n't run without him , the party acquiesced . as vice president , wallace made many international goodwill trips . most famously , he traveled to the soviet union , where he experienced a political transformation that resulted in him becoming an avowed soviet apologist . his communist leanings did nothing for his image , especially once he became secretary of commerce under president truman . in 1948 , wallace unsuccessfully ran for president on the progressive party ticket , espousing views that sounded shockingly marxist . he even described corporations as `` midget hitlers '' attempting to crush the labor class . but nobody can say wallace did n't know how to own up to his mistakes . in 1952 , he recanted his support of the soviet union in a magazine article called `` where i was wrong . '' by then , however , his political career was over . wallace spent the rest of his life conducting agricultural experiments on his farm in new york . 3 . william rufus de vane king : franklin pierce 's v.p. william r. king was sworn into office in cuba , becoming the only executive officer to take the oath on foreign soil . king had gone to cuba to recuperate from tuberculosis and severe alcoholism , but it did n't work . he died in 1853 after being vice president for just 25 days . that might not be the most memorable thing about king , though . it 's widely rumored that the former v.p. was homosexual . further still , he 's suspected of being james buchanan 's lover . neither king nor buchanan ever married , and they lived together in washington for 15 years before buchanan became president . of course , king 's predilection for wearing scarves and wigs only fanned the rumors . president andrew jackson used to call him `` miss nancy , '' and aaron brown , a fellow southern democrat , dubbed him `` aunt fancy . '' 4 . richard m. johnson : martin van buren 's v.p. despite his credentials as a war hero and a kentucky senator , vice president richard m. johnson was never accepted in washington . perhaps that 's because he dressed like a farmhand , cursed like a sailor , and made no secret of his three black mistresses , who were also his slaves . the first mistress bore him two daughters before she passed away ; the second tried to run off with a native american chief , but johnson captured and resold her ; and the third was the second one 's sister . johnson attempted to introduce this third mistress into polite society , but the couple was n't well-received . with the support of andrew jackson , johnson landed the vice presidency under martin van buren in 1836 . after four years of public relations disasters , jackson withdrew his support . nonetheless , van buren kept johnson on his ticket , and the two lost their re-election bid in 1840 . 5 . aaron burr : thomas jefferson 's v.p. no story on vice presidents would be complete without aaron burr -- best known for shooting and killing alexander hamilton in a duel in 1804 . after the incident , burr went back to presiding over the senate . from there , he plotted a treasonous conspiracy to become emperor of the western united states and mexico . the plan could have worked , but one of burr 's co-conspirators ratted him out . he was tried in 1807 before the supreme court , which found him not guilty , mainly because he had n't actually committed the treason yet . a free man , burr turned his sights on florida . he went to france and tried to convince napoleon bonaparte to help him conquer the swampland , but that plan foundered , too . although his political high jinks often failed , burr consistently found success with the ladies . after his wife died in 1794 , burr remained a bachelor for 40 years , making the acquaintance of several eligible socialites . he enjoyed flirtations with philadelphia debutantes , as well as a widow named dolley payne todd -- later known as dolley madison , wife of james madison . at age 76 , burr married a wealthy widow of ill-repute and plundered her fortune . citing numerous infidelities on his part , she filed for divorce and was actually granted it . unfortunately for her , it came through on the day burr died . 6 . andrew johnson : abraham lincoln 's 4th v.p. andrew johnson took his 1865 vice-presidential oath drunk as a skunk and belligerent as hell . having grown up dirt poor , johnson felt the aristocracy in washington had abused his kinfolk . glassy-eyed and smelling of whiskey , he reminded congress , the supreme court , the cabinet , and pretty much everyone within hearing distance that they owed their positions to `` plebeians '' such as himself , then kissed the bible and staggered away . needless to say , his address was poorly received . the new york world opined , `` to think that one frail life stands between this insolent , clownish creature and the presidency ! may god bless and spare abraham lincoln !

'' in june he won the classical ballet prize at the eurovision young dancer of the year competition held in paris . kumakawa experienced a meteoric rise through the ranks of the rbc . he quickly became a soloist , dancing the act 1 pas de trois in tchaikovsky 's ` swan lake ' and completed a memorable performance as the bronze idol in la bayadère -- a cameo role that showcased his extraordinary jumping ability . the following season he was chosen for the role of the fool in the premiere of kenneth macmillan 's ` the prince and the pagodas ' . in 1991 he was promoted to first soloist and was a principal dancer by 1993 . so developed a mutual love affair between kumakawa , his new fans and his adoptive city . `` i was so pleased to participate in british culture , '' he told the japan times in 2004 . by the age of 26 ` teddy ' , as he had become known to his friends in the uk -- ` kuma ' means ` bear ' in japanese -- had danced the full repertoire of classical and modern roles at the rbc . the man who had wowed london audiences with his acrobatic jumps and audacious turns was about to leap into a new chapter of his life . in 1998 he left the royal ballet to found his own company -- the k-ballet -- back home in tokyo . it was a highly controversial move at the time . not only had he upped sticks in the middle of a season , he also took five of the royal ballet 's star male performers with him to japan . the british press and the ballet fraternity were not impressed . greeted as a returning hero in his native country , kumakawa took on the roles of leading dancer , teacher , artistic director and company manager simultaneously . but despite the formidable workload and responsibility the new k-ballet flourished , fostering a wider interest in japanese ballet . in 2004 , kumakawa established the k-ballet school . the same year , the k-ballet became the first japanese ballet company to perform at the metropolitan opera house in new york . a career-threatening knee injury , suffered whilst on a k-ballet tour of japan in may 2007 has temporarily sidelined kumakawa from performing . but he expects to be back on stage next year , delighting audiences with virtuoso performances once again . in the meantime , kumakawa -- who continues to enjoy pop star status in japan -- continues to pass on his expertise to a new generation of dancers . e-mail to a friend .

'' it is a dramatic turn of events , considering odinga was shaking kibaki 's hand three days ago after the two met under the auspices of former united nations secretary-general kofi annan . many had hoped thursday 's meeting , arranged by annan who is mediating peace efforts , would bring an end to the outbreak of bloody ethnic battles that followed last month 's contested presidential vote . but it seems to have had the opposite effect . odinga blamed kibaki 's government for orchestrating the rift valley violence `` to try to influence mediation efforts '' and `` to divert -lrb- attention -rrb- from election malpractice to security and violence .

'' i asked one . `` si '' , the man replied . my producer , patricia pedraza , translated the rest . `` the fear is with both immigration and the police . now you can not trust absolutely anybody . '' in irving , texas , a dallas suburb of about 200,000 people , right next to the big airport , an estimated 40 percent of the city is latino , and anecdotally , we 're told there are a lot of undocumented workers here , people who are in the u.s. illegally , but clearly do n't view themselves as criminals . `` they take innocent people , they think we 're all the same , '' another undocumented worker told me . the fear is a reaction to what 's called the criminal alien program . since september of last year , irving police started to refer anyone arrested in their community to federal authorities , who check their immigration status . `` it 's only for people who have violated texas laws , and are arrested and brought into the irving jail , '' said larry boyd , irving 's police chief . as a result , referrals for deportations have shot up to 1,600 , more than 40 times the number from the year before . statistics from police show that while some of those referrals were for people who committed serious crimes , the majority were a result of misdemeanors and traffic warrants . many sources told me that a growing number of latinos here are afraid to drive . the risk is being caught with a suspended license , going to jail and getting deported . see the effect the program has had on irving '' but if some in the latino community are lying low , advocates for immigrants are speaking out -- accusing the city and police of targeting latinos without cause . `` we believe the criminal alien program is fundamentally wrong , '' says carlos quintanilla , an activist . `` that there is racial profiling going on . '' the city 's mayor , herbert gears , disagrees . he says police are not taking on the role of immigration officers . `` we will make sure people are being treated fairly , '' he said . `` that people are n't being pulled over because of the color of their skin . '' as i spent more time in irving , i came to realize that outside the large latino community , there is broad support for the program . `` you have to start somewhere , '' said sheik shah , an irving resident who emigrated to the u.s. from india and is now an american citizen . `` because right now , we have so many loopholes for people to come in here and work illegally . '' some were more direct . i read from two tall stacks of printed e-mail addressed to the city council , which were overwhelmingly supported the criminal alien program . one read : `` please help deport all illegals . what part of illegal do they not understand ? '' another : `` thank god some people are doing something about this invasion . '' in the end , irving is in the middle of a profound disagreement , between those who feel it 's wrong to refer people to immigration authorities for nonviolent crimes and misdemeanors , and those who believe illegal immigration has gone too far -- that something has to be done . as irving city council member beth van duyne told me : `` we need to know who is in our city . if you 're committing a crime , we need to know who you are . i do n't think that 's too much to ask .

'' have you always been a beauty chameleon ? in high school i would mess with my hair and makeup all the time . i used to wear a shirt that said `` ms. clairol '' because i changed my hair color so much . i was blond for a long time , then what my mom called `` barnyard red .

705	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- turkey snatched a last-gasp winner to eliminate euro 2008 co-hosts switzerland and keep their own quarterfinal hopes alive with a 2-1 victory in rain-drenched basel on wednesday night . patrick mueller , left , and swiss goalkeeper diego benaglio battle for the ball with arda turan of turkey . arda turan scored with a deflected effort in the third minute of time added on to set up a group a finale against the czech republic on sunday to determine who takes the second quarterfinal place behind portugal . the turks came from behind after hakan yakin gave the swiss a 32nd-minute lead , with substitute striker semih senturk heading a 57th-minute equalizer through the hands of goalkeeper diego benaglio . the st jakob park stadium had been flooded by a deluge early in the match , with the downpour continuing until just before half-time . the treacherous conditions made defending a nightmare for both teams , and arda almost put turkey ahead in the 29th minute with a farcical effort . with minimal visibility in the heavy rain , benaglio punched a vicious free-kick by stand-in captain nihat kahveci onto the head of the 21-year-old winger -- but the ball bounced to safety off the outside of the post . however , it was the swiss who adapted the better and they took the lead through the veteran yakin . he was on hand to awkwardly steer home from close range with his weaker right foot after eren derdiyok -- who like yakin is of turkish origin -- beat the offside trap to collect a long pass from defender philippe senderos . derdiyok calmly check inside the defense in the penalty area and sent a low cross towards yakin -- who had to wait anxiously at the far post as the ball was held up in a huge puddle of water . yakin had earlier been denied by turkey goalkeeper volkan demirel , who also did well to tip a swerving free-kick by tranquillo barnetta around the post . yakin also missed an even easier chance than the goal he scored in the 34th minute when he stabbed the ball wide of the post following a superb right-wing cross by valon behrami which cut out the defense and goal custodian . turkey , sensing a lucky escape , came out after the break with renewed purpose and posed a greater threat as the pitch slowly drained of the excess water . semih justified his second-half introduction when he rose highest to meet nihat 's superb inswinging cross from the left flank , and benaglio could only palm the powerful header into the back of the net . tempers flared as both sides went in search of the victory , but there was no repeat of the violent scenes that followed switzerland 's world cup playoff victory against the turks in november 2005 . volkan made another superb save from yakin , and turkey held off the swiss onslaught before arda cut in from the right and fired a shot from just outside the penalty area which clipped the heels of patrick mueller and looped over the helpless benaglio . `` i did wish for rain to stop . i did pray to god for that , '' turkey coach fatih terim told reporters . `` we could n't predict mud in the middle of the summer . `` it 's not easy to come back from a goal down at the european championship , considering we hit the woodwork once . but we fought a lot in the second half and we created many opportunities . '' he added : `` tonight we reminded everyone a little bit about turkey . against the czech republic , we will be unforgettable . '' defeat was a bitter blow for switzerland , whose fellow co-hosts austria will also be eliminated on thursday if they lose to poland in vienna . `` of course the disappointment is huge , '' switzerland coach koebi kuhn said . `` but i ca n't blame it on any player or anyone else . we lost twice unluckily .

706	new york -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- it 's been five years since carrie bradshaw journeyed to paris in search of true love on the series finale of `` sex and the city . '' she appeared to have found it in the arms of mr. big , and she returned to new york -- and her now-settled friends -- ready for a new start . sarah jessica parker was a driving force in creating the `` sex and the city '' movie . then came the inevitable cry : that 's it ? what happens next ? sarah jessica parker , who played carrie , wanted to find out as well . but the situation had to be right , she said , which prompted a cascade of rumors as plans for a movie came together , fell apart and came together again . now that the movie is out , parker -- who 's a producer of the film as well as one of its stars -- talked about the journey to making a big-screen `` sex and the city '' with `` showbiz tonight '' anchor a.j. hammer . the following is an edited version of that interview . cnn : i think a lot of fans , maybe a lot of people , and those of you among the cast , did n't think this day would actually ever come ... but here we are . so how are you feeling deep inside , sarah ? sarah jessica parker : i feel extraordinarily privileged . i 've spent the last two years cobbling this movie together . ... it 's a once-in-a-lifetime kind of professional experience and one really should n't be greedy enough to ask for it twice . watch the cast talk about the thrill of `` sex '' '' i have to say that , this last six , eight months , was better than those seven years -lsb- the show aired -rsb- and i think it 's because we all recognize how lucky and unique those seven years were and that this is a story that you do n't get to tell twice . it has been , i must say , worth every obstacle and dead end , and fit and start , and every moment that was seemingly impossible . it has been a dream . cnn : and i imagine sitting down for the first time in that room together for the table read , which was , from my understanding , the first time you all actually were in the same room -lsb- together -rsb- regardless of how much you kept in touch . tell me a little bit about that moment . parker : i started putting -lsb- the -rsb- script back together in april of 2006 ... and that -lsb- table read -rsb- was a really extraordinary day , because just the perfunctory details of getting people to a table read were complicated . kim -lsb- cattrall -rsb- had been away and kristin -lsb- davis -rsb- had been away and chris -lsb- noth -rsb- had been -lsb- doing -rsb- his other job , and this magnificent script had arrived and had been everything we hoped for and more . it was basically like being in an alternate universe for about three hours . ... it was a kind of reunion that is very , very special , because you really want to be there . it 's not the reunion where you 're forced by your parents to meet your aunts and uncles that you see rarely . it 's the reunion that you want . i think even more so was that first day on -lsb- the -rsb- set . when we thought , good god , -lsb- writer/director -rsb- michael patrick -lsb- king -rsb- and i are actually making this movie , like we got it done , we 're here , we 're doing it -- what a privilege . cnn : i think we as fans and viewers actually got a sense of what that feeling was like when we saw you all together on `` oprah , '' because the energy was ... palpable . ... but we 're talking about the perceived drama around this whole project . -lrb- rumors have abounded about friction between the stars . -rrb- one of my producers said while we were watching the tv , `` are they going to sit near each other ? '' `` why are they putting chris in the middle of all of them ? '' hearing that , does it make you mad ? parker : i find it slightly -- it 's not that i 'm mad . i expect better from people . i think it 's really beneath me , to keep defending myself . i have a 35-year career . i have an impeccable character , i really pride myself in my work ethic and the way i treat people . and i think kim would say the same and cynthia would say the same . and i love kim , and i wanted her to be in this movie . we could n't have done it without her , we could n't have done it without kristin , we could n't have done it without cynthia -lsb- nixon -rsb- , nor could we have done it without chris . watch cattrall address the rumors '' you know , this is a story that people like to tell about women . why ? i do n't know . is it that interesting ? probably not . so once again i just have to say it does n't define the experience . nobody can take the experience away . it 's far more interesting for me to talk about my affection for this cast than to start to deny a sad old beaten tale . cnn : you seem to have what goes on in the media in perspective -- and you have to , being at the game as long as you 've been . to that end , one of the things that i 've always admired about you and -lsb- husband -rsb- matthew -lsb- broderick -rsb- and i think a lot of people do , is how you 've managed your public or your private life while being in the glare of the spotlight . ... now i know one of the main reasons you guys are able to make it work is because you do n't talk about your private lives , which is great and i applaud that . that said , is there something that you can tell me about what it is about your relationship that enables you to make it work separate from that ? parker : i would n't make any proclamations about why i have a marriage that , to me , is successful . i would just say that we 've chosen to live in a city where we are not the most interesting people . this is a city that is about industry and finance and publishing and architecture and the arts and education and academia , and the movie industry fits into it in some small way , but there are a lot of people of important interest and i think that it 's a conscious choice to live in a place where we 're bumping up against humanity . we run to the market on our own , we take the subway , and we integrate into our city , and we become a part of the fabric and i think it 's really been to our benefit and certainly to our son . does it mean that we are not scrutinized and that we do n't have paparazzi every single day at our house ? no , but it is a city where you ca n't live behind a gate , you ca n't drive up in a car and be protected . you walk out the door and it is what it is . so you reconcile those things and you make the best choices you can . cnn : is it the end of `` sex and the city '' ? what does your gut tell you ? parker : my gut tells me it 's up to you and your colleagues and the critics and the people who show up . the future is dictated not by us at this point , and i think michael patrick and i have been so focused at getting this movie up on the big screen , that we have n't thought about the future . doing this was more than we could have asked for . so anything beyond that is really kind of out of our hands in a perfectly wonderful way .
707	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- croatia sent out a message of intent to the other euro 2008 finalists as they stunned highly-fancied germany 2-1 in klagenfurt to secure a place in the quarterfinals . ivicia olic celebrates croatia 's second goal in their superb 2-1 victory over germany . darijo srna and ivica olic struck the goals as croatia , who had only ever beaten germany once before , produced arguably the first major upset of the tournament . lukas podolski pulled a goal back late on for germany with his third strike in two games to set up a nail-biting finale , but there was to be no way back for joachim loew 's team , who finished with 10 men following the 90th-minute dismissal of substitute bastian schweinsteiger . both sides came into the game having won their opening matches , although germany had looked far more impressive in seeing off poland than croatia had in defeating austria . however , it was slaven bilic 's side who turned on the style at the worthersee stadion as they took control of group b with two wins out of two . a frantic start to the match promised much but for all their huffing and puffing , neither side were able to create anything resembling a chance in the opening 20 minutes as defences held firm . the ball did find its way into the back of the net in the 22nd minute when germany striker mario gomez slotted home past stipe pletikosa but the offside flag had already gone up against the stuttgart man . the deadlock was broken for real just two minutes after that incident though , when croatia went ahead through srna . danijel pranjic sent over a superb cross from the left and srna nipped in front of marker marcell jansen to slide the ball in at the far post , giving veteran germany goalkeeper jens lehmann no chance . croatia had a gilt-edged chance to make it 2-0 in the 30th minute , but niko kranjcar wasted it . ivan rakitic chipped a pass into the area which was flicked back towards the penalty spot by olic , but the in-rushing kranjcar was unable to cap a well-worked move as he blazed over . germany knew they needed to step up through the gears and they finally made pletikosa earn his keep with two efforts in rapid succession . the first saw pletikosa push away a thunderous michael ballack free-kick , before the spartak moscow custodian awkwardly deflected away a christoph metzelder effort with his knee . metzelder then headed a torsten frings corner just over from close range as the germans stepped up their efforts for an equalizer before the break . however , loew 's side very nearly found themselves two goals behind in the 43rd minute , and they needed a fine reaction stop from lehmann to deny kranjcar , who chested down olic 's pass and smashed in a first-time volley . having seen his side let off the hook , loew opted for a more adventurous approach in the second half as he sacrificed full-back jansen for jet-heeled winger david odonkor during the interval . aside from a ballack shot over the crossbar though , croatia looked fairly comfortable at the start of the period and also had a decent effort of their own with luka modric firing in a shot that lehmann gathered , although not before seeing it squirm through his hands first . however , lehmann 's next task was to pick the ball out of the back of his net as croatia stunned the germans with a second goal in the 62nd minute . a rakitic cross from the right took a deflection off podolski before arrowing goalwards and although lehmann , who had begun to come out for the initial cross , managed to dive backwards and get a hand on it , the ball struck his near post before rebounding back out to olic , who had the easy task of slotting home . germany looked for an immediate response but aside from a schweinsteiger shot that fizzed across the face of goal , they were still finding it difficult to create chances against a well-organised croatia backline . loew 's side earned themselves a lifeline with 12 minutes to go though when podolski lashed home a shot on the half-volley after the ball had fallen kindly to him in the box . germany could not build on that goal , though , and their final hopes of getting anything out of the match all but disappeared when schweinsteiger was given a straight red card for shoving jerko leko in the final minute of an absorbing encounter . `` i want to especially congratulate my players , not only for the fight they showed but for playing an excellent match , '' said a delighted bilic . `` there is no other way to beat the germans than to play well . they 're still a great team , though , and still one of the favorites for the title . '' ballack said the germans had to recognize they must improve . `` our movement was not fluid enough throughout the match and as a consequence we eked out few chances . `` we played below our level in all departments . now we absolutely have to win our last match against austria , '' said the chelsea midfielder .
708	-lrb- mental floss -rrb- -- starting a legitimate business is hard , boring work . there 's paperwork to fill out , employees to hire , and all sorts of other drudgery , not to mention the biggest hurdle of all : providing a product or service for which customers are willing to pay . president ulysses s. grant foiled a gold scam . in all likelihood , it would be much easier to just stumble upon some clever scam to line your pockets . or so it would seem . as many aspiring scam artists quickly learn , when a business scam fails , it tends to fail in rather grand fashion . just ask any of these four teams of not-so-smooth operators . a corny sea story . xenothemis and hegestratos may not have been the world 's first white-collar criminals , but they were certainly noteworthy for their incompetence . in 360 b.c. , the pair stumbled upon what seemed like a killer plan to make some quick cash . shipping was extremely risky at the time , and boats went down at sea with alarming frequency . to exploit this uncertainty , xenothemis and hegestratos devised a plan in which they would receive a cash advance to ship a load of corn from syracuse to athens . due to the dangers associated with shipping , the buyer would take on full risk if the shipment did n't make it to athens , so if the boat sank xenothemis and hegestratos could keep their cash . instead of loading the ship with expensive corn , the conniving pair made a plan to sail an empty ship out to sea for a few days , then sink it and escape in lifeboats . since the boat itself was insured , this plot seemed airtight , and the potential profit was great . unfortunately , though , the boat 's other passengers allegedly caught wind of the scheme during the attempting scuttling of the ship . these passengers were understandably a bit peeved at hegestratos ' attempts to drown them for his own financial gain . hegestratos panicked and jumped overboard , at which point he drowned . unable to sink the ship by himself , xenothemis had to sail on to the port , at which point the buyer , protos , wanted to know why his shipload of corn was empty . a legal battle followed , and although the verdict has been lost by history , it 's safe to say that the late hegestratos regretted the scam . when friday went black . despite his prowess as a general , ulysses s. grant 's presidency did n't go so smoothly . ones of its most notable scandals occurred in 1869 , when a group of speculators upended the u.s gold market . the plan started when financier james fisk and robber baron jay gould formed a group of speculators with the goal of cornering the gold market , which would give the group the ability to manipulate the price . of course , one can only corner the market if there 's a fixed quantity of gold available . otherwise , the government could just sell large quantities of gold , and the cornering effort would be an expensive failure . in an effort to avoid this fate , gould and fisk brought president grant 's brother-in-law abel corbin into their fold . using corbin 's influence to get an audience with the president , the pair would argue to grant that selling gold was a terrible idea that the government should avoid at all costs . the wily pair also used their influence at the white house to secure a position as assistant treasurer of the united states for daniel butterfield , who would warn them if the government started to sell gold . with their connections in place , fisk and gould started buying up gold in september 1869 , quickly driving the price of gold up by around 30 percent . once grant and his advisors got wise to the situation , though , the government quickly sold off $ 4 million in gold to break the corner , effectively killing the inflated prices on september 24 . as investors scrambled to get rid of their overpriced gold , the price plummeted sharply , and many involved in the scam lost huge amounts of money . fisk and gould managed to avoid big losses due to their connections in the treasury , but what would be known as black friday did n't earn them a huge windfall -- and significantly harmed the american economy . bad moves . if you 've ever hired movers , you know it can be pretty pricey . erik deri , the founder of woodinville , washington-based nationwide moving systems , understood that most movers were expensive , so he drummed up business by offering super-cheap quotes to frugal clients . the customers were ecstatic to find a mover who could get their belongings to a new home so cheaply . that is , until the price went up . deri 's movers would load the company 's vans with all of a customer 's worldly belongings , then a foreman would inform the client that they 'd have to pay an inflated price to actually get their stuff to their new digs . the price hikes were n't small , either ; one man 's estimate stated he could move for $ 3,000 but was later revised to $ 16,000 after loading . according to authorities , if customers balked at these demands , the movers would threaten to unload their boxes and furniture into the street ... and then charge them an unloading fee . if things got really sticky , nationwide 's trucks could just take off with all of the clients ' possessions . deri supposedly paid cash bonuses to employees who successfully strong-armed customers into forking over the premiums . in the end , though , deri learned that you ca n't scam that many customers and hope to get away with it . in 2005 he was found guilty of 27 counts of extortion and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and extortion . three of his accomplices were also convicted in connection with the moving racket . deri was sentenced to seven years in prison , after which he 'll face deportation to his native israel . fools for gold . bre-x minerals ltd. was a small canadian mining company that made a big announcement in 1995 . geologists had discovered gold on a site bre-x owned near busang , indonesia . not just a little gold , either -- at least 30 million ounces , possibly as much as 200 million ounces . given the high prices of gold , such a deposit would have been worth tens of billions of dollars . bre-x 's stock price shot through the roof ; shares went from being valued at a few cents to over $ 280 canadian . in fact , the deposit seemed so rich and so large that a small company like bre-x could not possibly handle it all without some help . in 1997 , the indonesian government convinced bre-x to take on an american firm as a partner to help extract the gold . when this firm , freeport-mcmoran , started sampling the soil at the deposit site as part of its due diligence , it reached a confusing conclusion : there was n't any gold in the soil . subsequent examinations by independent auditors reached the same conclusion . the `` natural '' gold that in the original samples bre-x had taken was mostly river gold from other regions or shavings off of gold jewelry . although the company 's market cap had climbed to $ 4.4 billion , this report quickly destroyed bre-x 's value . share prices dropped 97 percent in a day following the announcement , the company was soon removed from the toronto stock exchange and nasdaq , and bre-x quickly went bankrupt . amazingly , no one ended up in jail from this scam , but you should still probably be wary if anyone offers to sell you an enormous gold mine on borneo . for more mental_floss articles , visit mentalfloss.com . entire contents of this article copyright , mental floss llc . all rights reserved .

710	kathmandu , nepal -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- nepal 's former king said wednesday he is not going to leave his country even though the monarchy has been abolished . gyanendra came to power in 2001 following the assassination of king birendra and his family . ex-king gyanendra , 60 , made remarks to reporters before departing the narayanhiti royal palace in kathmandu . he will live as a civilian in the former himalayan kingdom that was made a republic last month , and he will reside in a summer palace on a forested hilltop outside the capital . a few hundred journalists crammed into the opulent palace 's lobby entrance to hear gyanendra 's remarks . it was a chaotic and undeferential scene replete with pushing , shoving and scuffling -- even while the former monarch was speaking . while the former king spoke , reporters looked around at the lavish furnishings , including a huge crystal chandelier , stuffed tigers , stuffed rhino heads mounted on the walls and paintings of previous monarchs . gyanendra , who expressed his `` love '' for `` independent nepal , '' said all of his property will remain in the country and that he has no property outside the nation . `` i have no intention or thoughts to leave the country , '' he said . `` i will stay in the country to help establish peace . '' the monarchy 's end after 239 years of rule was the culmination of a two-year peace process in which maoist insurgents in nepal gave up their armed struggle , joined mainstream politics and won the most seats in april 's election for the constituent assembly . the assembly is tasked with rewriting the constitution , deciding the country 's future political system and governing the nation . gyanendra , who noted that the country is going through a `` serious '' stage now , said he accepts the new reality of a republic and reflected on the actions of the monarchy . `` i have done all i can to cooperate with -lrb- the government 's -rrb- directives , '' he said , and added that `` the monarchy in nepal has always been with the people of nepal in good times and bad times . '' gyanendra came to power in 2001 when his brother , king birendra , and his family were massacred in the palace by the crown prince , who later shot himself . gyanendra on wednesday denied rumors that he had played a role in that event . the ex-monarch also discussed events of 2005 , when he he took over the civilian government to take on the maoist insurgency , an unpopular move that sparked protests . he said he hopes people `` understand '' he did n't intend to infringe on any of the rights of the people . he left the palace by a side entrance with pro-royalists and pro-republicans gathered outside to see his departure . his car had to stop momentarily as journalists took pictures of him . gyanendra 's royal scepter and a crown of peacock feathers , yak hair and jewels remain in the palace and have been handed over to the government . -- from cnn 's dan rivers and manesh shrestha .

'' rooney has been dubbed `` shrek '' and `` mr potato head '' due to his looks and his background as the son of a school dinner lady who grew up on a council estate is often referred to in a disparaging way . mcloughlin , meanwhile , has been subjected to page upon page of bitter stories about her weight , shopping sprees and her lack of closeness to victoria beckham . there has also been fierce criticism over the fact she has managed to become a millionaire in her own right . it 's all down to rooney apparently , and nothing to do with her appearing to be quite a decent person , who did well at school and has cleverly managed to parlay some of her fame into various media and advertising projects . anyone who has seen her television show -- coleen 's real women -- can see she is a decent , bubbly person , who is very good at putting people at ease . much to the media 's fury , the couple have sold the rights to cover the wedding to ok magazine for a record $ 5 million . however they 're not pocketing all the cash themselves , with an undisclosed sum from the fee to be donated to the claire house children 's hospice in cheshire -- where mcloughlin 's disabled foster sister rosie is cared for . the queen 's grandson , peter phillips and his bride autumn kelly , recently received $ 1m from hello magazine to cover their wedding but they did n't receive an eighth of the opprobrium now directed at the more generous , but lower class , rooney and mcloughlin . moreover , in lieu of presents , rooney and mcloughlin have also asked guests to donate money to the alder hey children 's hospital in liverpool . the wedding might be over the top , with a private yacht and luxury jet for guests -lrb- they are covering the guests ' costs -rrb- , expensive plonk and a $ 200,000 wedding dress , but at least the couple have worked hard for what they have . their success despite a working-class background appears to be the greatest source of frustration for critics . it 's just not on that someone who was n't born into privilege and did n't go to a posh school can enjoy their wealth . that would be ugly . if anything , the couple 's relationship and success is a triumph over adversity . they have known each other since mcloughlin was 12 , but she spent two years fending off rooney 's entreaties to go out on a date . he finally got his chance when he saw her struggling to fix a broken bicycle chain . he rode over to help , popped the question again and got a yes . surely they should be congratulated for creating their own modern fairytale complete with butterflies ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .

714	london , england -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- graeme le saux played more than 400 matches for blackburn , chelsea and southampton , winning a premier league title and 36 international caps . cnn 's don riddell talks to the former england star about homophobia and racism in the game . graeme le saux , pictured here playing for chelsea , endured homophobic abuse throughout his career due to false rumors he was gay . don riddell : graeme , you 're happily married with two children but during your football career everyone thought you were gay and the experience was pretty miserable . graeme le saux : the culture of football back in the 80s was very different , something i found very hard to relate to and subsequently i found myself a little bit isolated and ostracized from certain people . that eventually led to rumors being spread that i was gay . in the context of modern life that 's not defamatory but in terms of the dressing room culture that existed then -- and to an extent now -- it was very difficult for me to deal with and had the potential to damage my career . i think that the joke very quickly got out of hand . and i think where i was at fault was that i was probably a little sensitive about it , because i could actually see the potential of this sort of thing to get out of control . and it did . we played in a game at west ham and the terraces started singing something particularly defamatory about me and i remember being , you know , really , really shocked that it got to that level so quickly . dr : and that carried on as well and the most notable incident is the one involving robbie fowler . tell me about that ? gs : it all culminated in a game that we played at stamford bridge against liverpool and robbie fowler , he stood in front of 40,000 people and he bent over and invited me to perform a homosexual act upon him ... that 's the politest way i can put it ! that really was the point at which it could n't get any worse . it was n't just people singing on the terrace , it was a colleague -- an international colleague -- humiliating you in front of all those people , an international audience . he will maintain to this day that it was just a laugh but that is exactly the point . if you look at anything like this , whether it is racism or homophobia or whatever , as if it is just a laugh that can be a very serious issue . i 'm all for a good laugh but when you offend someone and you are damaging relationships then it goes way beyond being a laugh and you ca n't hide behind that as an excuse . dr : it 's thought that only one professional soccer player in the world has ever declared himself to be gay . that was the englishman justin fashanu and he committed suicide a decade ago . john amaechi became the first gay player to be associated with the nba last year , but such declarations are extremely rare . in many cases homosexuality remains pro sport 's last taboo . gs : it 's such a terrible reflection on a sport that has so much positive impact across the globe that there is still this issue about gay people within the sport . if you look at so many other professions in terms of business and politics , across the board the gay community is represented but in football it still is n't and i find that disappointing . there may not be many gay players in the game but the sport should be grown up enough to be able to support those people in the football environment . dr : football 's obviously made great strides , certainly in britain , in the last 10 years with regards to racism , but how much prejudice is there generally in the game ? do you think we 'll ever be free of it ? gs : i think there 's always going to be an undercurrent of prejudice . but ultimately i think it 's important for any business really to be responsible , inclusive and representative of its employees . and football is in a very privileged position and can lead by example . and so i hope that , you know , the people in authority really make some serious attempts , i suppose to create parity between all walks of life . dr : we 've come across a couple of black footballers who say that fans who shout racist abuse are n't really racist , they are just trying to put us off our game . how much do you buy into that approach ? gs : well , i ca n't speak for individual black players ! but sometimes i think the perception of people it is not happening to is different to the individual . it used to baffle me when i first started playing that you 'd have chelsea fans being racist to black players from the opposition but there would be three or four black players on the chelsea 's team . and if you spoke to them or confronted them about it , they would be like , `` oh yeah , but we know them ... they are , you know , they are fine . '' and it 's like , well how do you pick the bones out of that ? because there is just no logic . but then you know prejudice is built on ignorance . you know it really is . i think that sometimes you know individuals have to take responsibility for themselves and actually take a step back and look at what they are doing and not use ignorance as an excuse and say , `` well , would i like to be on the receiving end of this sort of abuse ?

'' militants in gaza have launched more than 2,300 mortars and rockets since the start of 2008 , more than the 2,000 launched in all of last year , according to israeli military figures . while most of the attacks do not result in casualties , three israelis have been killed in rocket and mortar strikes in recent weeks . the israeli military responds to the attacks by carrying out airstrikes and ground operations in gaza that target militants , but many times lead to civilian casualties -- further inflaming the palestinian leadership . israel also has restricted supplies of gasoline , diesel and electricity to gaza , limited the amount of food and other goods entering the strip and made it virtually impossible for manufacturers and farmers in gaza to export anything to the outside world . hamas seized control of gaza last year after routing palestinian security agencies under the control of palestinian president mahmoud abbas and his fatah movement . the ouster forced abbas to dissolve the fatah-hamas unity government , but fatah still controls the west bank . representatives from the rival factions met recently in senegal for talks aimed at restoring the political and territorial split . earlier this month , abbas called for `` national unity '' talks with hamas with the goal of producing new elections for the palestinians , who elected a hamas-led palestinian authority government in a u.s.-backed vote in 2006 . meanwhile , abbas ' western-backed government is working toward a peace agreement with israel . the bush administration has said it wants the two sides to reach an agreement by the end of the year . cnn 's shira medding contributed to this report .
726	washington -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- former terrorist suspects detained by the united states were tortured , according to medical examinations detailed in a report released wednesday by a human rights group . a u.s. serviceman with his dog watches a detainee at abu ghraib prison in iraq in 2003 . the massachusetts-based physicians for human rights reached that conclusion after two-day clinical evaluations of 11 former detainees , who had been held at the abu ghraib prison in iraq , at guantanamo bay , cuba , and in afghanistan . the detainees were never charged with crimes . `` we found clear physical and psychological evidence of torture and abuse , often causing lasting suffering , '' said dr. allen keller , a medical evaluator for the study . in a 121-page report , the doctors ' group said that it uncovered medical evidence of torture , including beatings , electric shock , sleep deprivation , sexual humiliation , sodomy and scores of other abuses . the report is prefaced by retired u.s. major gen. antonio taguba , who led the army 's investigation into the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in 2003 . watch why a rights group says there 's evidence of torture '' `` there is no longer any doubt that the current administration committed war crimes , '' taguba says . `` the only question is whether those who ordered torture will be held to account . '' over the years , reports of abuses at abu ghraib and allegations of torture at guantanamo prompted the bush administration to deny that the u.s. military tortures detainees . since only 11 detainees were examined `` the findings of this assessment can not be generalized to the treatment of all detainees in u.s. custody , '' the report says . however , the incidents documented are consistent with findings of other investigations into government treatment , `` making it reasonable to conclude that these detainees were not the only ones abused , but are representative of a much larger number of detainees subjected to torture and ill treatment while in u.s. custody . '' four of the men evaluated were arrested in or taken to afghanistan between late 2001 and early 2003 and later were sent to guantanamo bay , where they were held for an average of three years before being released without charge , the report says . the other seven were detained in iraq in 2003 and released within a year , the report says . all the subjects told examiners that they were subjected to multiple forms of torture or ill treatment that `` often occurred in combination over a long period of time , '' the report says . while the report presents synopses of the detainees ' backgrounds based on interviews with them , the authors did not have access to the detainees ' medical histories . therefore , there 's no way to know whether any of the inmates may have had medical or mental problems before being detained . among the ex-detainees was an iraqi in his mid-40s , identified only as laith , whom u.s. soldiers took into custody in october 2003 and who was released from abu ghraib in june 2004 . according to the report , laith was subjected to sleep deprivation , electric shocks and threats of sexual abuse to himself and his family . `` they took off even my underwear . they asked me to do some movements that make me look in a very bad way so they can take photographs . ... they were trying to make me look like an animal , '' laith told examiners , according to the report . according to the report , laith said the most `` painful '' experiences involved threats to his family : `` and they asked me , ` have you ever heard voices of women in this prison ? ' i answered , ` yes . ' they were saying , ` then you will hear your mothers and sisters when we are raping them . ' '' the examiners concluded in the report that `` laith appears to have suffered severe and lasting physical and psychological injuries as a result of his arrest and incarceration at abu ghraib prison . '' another detainee , youssef , was detained by u.s. soldiers nearly seven years ago when he tried to enter afghanistan from neighboring pakistan without a passport , the report says . he initially was held in an afghan prison , where he describes `` being stripped naked , being intimidated by dogs , being hooded and being thrown against the wall on repeated occasions , '' the report says . a few months later , he was taken to the guantanamo bay facility , where he was subjected to interrogators who would enter his cell and force him to lie on the floor with his hands tied behind his back to his feet , the report says . youssef said the interrogators wanted him to confess of involvement with the taliban , the report says . based on its investigation , the report calls on the u.s. government to issue a formal apology to detainees subject to torture and ill treatment by the military since fall 2001 in afghanistan , iraq , guantanamo bay and elsewhere . the rights group also demands that the bush administration : . • `` repudiate all forms of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment '' ; . • establish an independent commission to investigate and report publicly the circumstances of detention and interrogation at u.s.-run prisons in afghanistan , iraq and guantanamo bay ; . • hold individuals involved in torturing detainees accountable through criminal and civil processes ; and . • monitor thoroughly the conditions at u.s.-run prisons all over the world . cnn radio contributed to this report .

'' with the help of the national guard , sebastian and his fellow residents hustled tuesday to build a barrier between gladstone and the encroaching floodwaters . even though gladstone is about four miles from the banks of the mississippi , the rising floodwaters have submerged homes and created rivers where crop fields once stood . the muddy townspeople worked with anxious resolve , cracking the occasional joke , as they filled bags with sand and dirt and loaded them onto atvs . on the receiving end were members of the illinois national guard , who piled up the sandbags as the tops of cornstalks rose above the waters behind them . `` threats can happen in all shapes and forms , so we are trying to help out , '' said national guardsman capt. lanny finn , whose unit previously served in iraq . `` we 'll be here for as long as we 're needed .

' they said , ` no , we do n't need them . ' so we offered them to the other states . '' a cnn investigation revealed last week that fema gave away 121 truckloads of material the agency amassed after 2005 's hurricane katrina . the material was declared surplus property and offered to federal and state agencies -- including louisiana , where groups working to resettle hurricane victims say the supplies are still needed . paulison told cnn 's `` late edition with wolf blitzer '' his agency distributed more than 90,000 `` living kits '' to people in louisiana whose homes were destroyed or damaged by katrina . the kits included cleaning supplies , mops , brooms , pots and pans . after cnn reported on the giveaway , louisiana officials asked that the supplies be redirected to the state , which originally passed on them . john medica , director of the louisiana 's federal property assistance agency , told cnn he was unaware katrina victims still needed the items because no agency had contacted his office . sen. mary landrieu of louisiana , an outspoken critic of fema 's response to the hurricane , told cnn the supply giveaway was `` just a shame . '' `` it 's just another example of the failings of the federal bureaucracy , '' said landrieu , who wrote homeland security secretary michael chertoff last week to request an explanation . `` we 're still trying to fix it . it 's going to take a lot more work . '' paulison said much of the stockpile included `` things we do n't normally store -- refrigerators , stoves , coolers , diapers , things like that .

'' paulison said the story `` just really missed the mark '' -- that the supplies given away were not exclusively for katrina victims , but were `` donated from disasters all around the entire country . '' but e-mails from mcintyre and from the general services administration , which manages federal property , contradict paulison 's account . in an e-mail sent in april , mcintyre told cnn `` in many cases , items were purchased in the field by fema . '' and in a phone interview with cnn , mcintyre said , `` that is property that was purchased in response to katrina . we purchased most of that equipment because of the catastrophic nature of that disaster . '' general services administration spokeswoman viki reath wrote the supplies given away were `` surplus from the katrina and -lsb- hurricane -rsb- rita disasters ... some purchased by fema , some donated by foreign countries and federal government agencies .

'' `` to help create jobs in america , we need to lower taxes and open up foreign markets to american goods , '' said mccain spokesman tucker bounds . `` americans can not afford barack obama 's ` change ' that takes us back to the failed policies of the past . '' but obama said now was the time to commit to long-term investments in america 's future and blasted mccain for wanting to continue president bush 's economic policies , saying `` there is a clear choice in this election . instead of reaching for new horizons , george bush has put us in a hole , and john mccain 's policies will keep us there . i want to take us in a new and better direction . `` i reject the belief that we should either shrink from the challenge of globalization or fall back on the same tired and failed approaches of the last eight years , '' he said . `` it 's time for new policies that create the jobs and opportunities of the future -- a competitiveness agenda built upon education and energy , innovation and infrastructure , fair trade and reform .

'' two weeks later , police found the man -- 39-year-old shawn rogers , a computer consultant with a young son and a wife at the time . police were unable to charge rogers with anything more than trespassing ... until he came back to nicole 's apartment to steal her camera . police were able to charge rogers with burglary , and he was sentenced to eight years in prison . dangerous behavior . when nicole found the ups box on her balcony , gavin says this was a warning sign . gavin applauds nicole for listening to her intuition and says that quieting her fear could have caused the situation to escalate . `` he 's already into behavior of wanting to get caught , '' he says . `` you do n't come back again and again and again and not want to get caught . '' gavin says like nicole , the intruder 's intuition was probably trying to tell him something too . `` offenders as well can see what 's happening in their lives . and talk about not listening to it -- he 's in someone 's apartment doing something sexual with their clothes on -- that 's something to listen to .

' because my mother lives with me , and she 'll turn on the lights when it gets dark . it did give me a little eerie feeling -- the hairs on the back of your neck kind of stand up . but still , i did n't listen to my instincts . '' gavin says that `` eerie feeling '' is exactly what he wants women to pay attention to . `` we 're trying to analyze the warning signs , '' he says . `` and what i really want to teach today and forever is the feeling is the warning sign . all the other stuff is our explanation for the feeling . why it was this , why it was that . the feeling itself is the warning sign .

'' obama 's campaign says she was just excited about the grassroots support , but her words still provided fodder for her husband 's opponents . the day after the comments , cindy mccain , wife of presumptive republican nominee john mccain , introduced her husband saying , `` i do n't know about you , if you heard those words earlier -- i am very proud of my country . '' michelle obama has been a vocal advocate for her husband while on the campaign trail , delivering sometimes impassioned speeches on his behalf . robin givhan , fashion editor with the washington post , said people see michelle obama in different ways . `` some people will see confidence , and others might see cockiness . i think some people will see strength . others might see arrogance , '' she said . `` she comes across as someone who is extraordinarily independent and very much a force to be reckoned with . '' behind the scenes , she maintains that independence . according to the campaign , michelle obama picks out her own clothes . she received a lot of attention for the sleeveless purple dress and pearls she wore the night her husband became the presumptive democratic nominee . beyond her style , though , a sense of dignity may be what most defines a first lady . it 's a job that requires the ability to strike a balance between queen and commoner . exactly how michelle obama refines her approach on the stump remains to be seen , staffers said . `` we 'll see , '' jarrett said . `` she 's learned a lot of stories along the way from the american people , i think she may incorporate some more of the stories that she 's heard that resonate with what she 's seeing in terms of the direction that people want the country to take . but the rest is up to her . we 'll see what she comes up with .

'' when he vetoed the first version of the farm bill , bush said it `` continues subsidies for the wealthy and increases farm bill spending by more than $ 20 billion , while using budget gimmicks to hide much of the increase . '' the president said it would hurt efforts to improve american farmers ' access to overseas markets . congress has passed one other bill over bush 's objections : legislation for a $ 23 billion water project that the president vetoed in 2007 . cnn capitol hill producer deirdre walsh contributed to this report .

'' watch tina watson 's family demand justice '' the couple married just 11 days earlier in birmingham , alabama . they left their home in hoover , alabama , for their australian honeymoon two days later , the coroner said . as possible evidence for the husband 's motive , glascow pointed to a statement by the woman 's father that watson asked her to maximize her life insurance and make him the beneficiary shortly before the wedding . the insurance company confirmed that gabe watson inquired about her life insurance policy after her death , the coroner said . the coroner noted that watson , through his lawyers , contended that police had made a judgment that he killed his wife before they began their investigation and that they tailored their investigation to fit their theory . glascow said he saw no evidence of police rushing to judgment . `` it appears certain that at some point in time , investigators considered some of gabe 's explanations lacked credibility , and it further appears to me that investigators gave gabe the opportunity to clarify matters which may have caused concern , '' the coroner said . the husband was an experienced diver , and his new wife was considered a novice , the coroner said . they were diving on the yongala shipwreck about 42 miles off the coast of townsville in the state of queensland , australia .
745	-lrb- cnn -rrb- -- the supreme court ruled wednesday morning that child rapists can not be given the death penalty , effectively reserving the punishment only for murderers . cnn 's jeffrey toobin said the court 's ruling falls in line with other decisions on the death penalty . the 5-4 decision stems from a louisiana case in which patrick kennedy , 43 , was sentenced to die in 2003 for the sexual assault of his 8-year-old stepdaughter . proponents of louisiana 's law , which allowed child rapists to be eligible for the death penalty , say that besides murder , no crime is more deserving of the death penalty than child rape . kennedy would have been the first rapist in 44 years to be executed for a crime in which the victim was not killed . in the majority opinion , justice anthony kennedy said `` evolving standards of decency '' forbid capital punishment for any crime other than murder . cnn 's senior legal analyst , jeffrey toobin , spoke with cnn 's heidi collins outside the supreme court about the impact of the ruling . collins : this is a huge decision here . what do you make of it ? toobin : it was just high drama in the court today . it 's always dramatic at the end of the supreme court term . here it was literally life and death , one of the big open questions in constitutional law about the death penalty : can you execute someone for a crime other than murder ? anthony kennedy , the swing vote on so many cases , decided this case , it was 5-4 . ... he did n't diminish the seriousness of the crime , but he said the risks of expanding the death penalty are simply too great . he pointed out that there are more than 5,000 child rapes every year in the united states . all of them would raise the possibility of the death penalty . there are only a handful of states -- i think it was six -- that allow the death penalty for child rape . forty-four states and the federal government say no . he said there is a national consensus that this is not an appropriate punishment . so , this really rules out not just the death penalty for child rape , but any crime other than murder . so it 's a major , major decision . see more about the reach of the decision '' collins : a national consensus except those six states . it 's interesting when you look at the court of public opinion . how do you think this decision is going to go down in public ? toobin : well , i think it 's a tough call because support for the death penalty nationwide in the past 10 years has actually been going down . but child rape is such a horrendous crime and all of us have such a natural revulsion towards it that you 're never going to get a lot of support for any sort of reduction in sentence . but i think , given the fact that this is a supreme court that said no death penalty for murderers under 18 , no death penalty for the mentally retarded , this decision is consistent with a certain restriction on the death penalty , which is reflected in the court but also in a kind of national change that 's going on . collins : and in sean callebs ' piece that we had , i do n't know if you heard it . toobin : i saw it , yeah . collins : one woman , who actually brought up a very interesting point , when you think about all of this and when you think about the child , the victim , she said , you know , if they know they 're going to die for this crime , why would they leave a living witness ? toobin : justice kennedy made precisely that point in the opinion . he said , allowing the death penalty here would create a perverse incentive for child rapists to murder their victims . he also pointed out what a difficult moral choice it would put child victims in testifying , giving children literally the power of life and death in their testimony over their attackers . that is something that he wanted to relieve children of -- that burden . collins : will they always have to testify ? toobin : yeah , pretty much . there have been rare examples ... if a child , for example , is simply too young to testify . there are horrible cases of rapes of babies and things like that . but by and large there has to be some sort of testimony from a child . it can be in a noncourtroom setting . it can be sort of in a deposition , not in front of the jury . but you do have to have the child testify . collins : it 's just such a tough decision all around . 5-4 on that one , very interesting .

748	los angeles , california -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- luke russert , son of journalist tim russert , was part of a panel wednesday that discussed youth voting on cnn 's `` larry king live . '' luke russert says dinner table political discussions were part of his upbringing . besides the youth vote , russert discussed his father 's death , his upbringing and his own future in journalism and political commentary . tim russert , 58 , was the host of nbc 's `` meet the press '' and one of america 's leading political journalists . he died of a heart attack after collapsing at the network 's washington bureau on june 13 . the following is an edited version of the show 's transcript . watch video of the discussion '' larry king : how did you learn of your dad 's passing ? luke russert : i was in florence , and i was at an italian sports bar watching the italy versus romania game , and i got a call from my dad 's secretary that said he had fainted , and could i get in touch with my mother . luckily , i was right across the street from the hotel where my mom was . i ran up to her room and said , `` dad has fainted . '' and we kind of learned in increments of what exactly happened . so it was basically about a half-hour after first hearing that he fainted that we actually knew he collapsed and had a heart attack . and at first , i was upset that i was so far away and removed . and i really wanted to be there . but in reality , it was really a blessing to be an ocean away , because it allowed my mother and me to have some real private time to collect our thoughts , to grieve in private , and not be inundated with all the media coverage and all the phone calls . so , you know , it was something that -- it was difficult , but to have that little cocoon , i think my mother and i really used it to our benefit . king : must have been a long flight back . russert : it was . it was a long nine-hour flight . but my mother has been so strong through this . and my family has been there for me every step of the way . my girlfriend has been wonderful . so i ca n't thank everybody enough . and obviously this happened , but it has made it a lot easier to have such good friends at nbc and all through washington and my family personally . king : were you brought up talking politics ? russert : i was . it was always something that was always talked around the dinner table with my father and my mother from a very young age . one of my earliest memories is being a young toddler and remembering ronald reagan 's face on television . my dad was watching a press conference , most likely at that time on cnn . and it was just something that i always grew up around . and we also talked a lot of sports . we talked a lot of culture . but politics was something that i guess has been engrained in me at a very , very young age . king : did he pick the brains of you and your friends ? russert : he did . we would actually have some fun discussions where i would assume the role of who his guest would be on sunday and try to answer the questions that he threw at me . and sometimes , if i could answer a question pretty well , he 'd say , `` that question 's too easy , i 've got to get rid of it . '' so sometimes , i was a guinea pig for politicians . but it was a lot of fun . i enjoyed doing it . and he would also pick the brains of some of my friends . some did pretty well , and some did n't . but he was always kind to all of us . king : when did you first vote ? russert : i first voted when i was 18 , which would have been 2004 . and i registered at the same time i registered for the selective service , which i think they do here in the district of columbia . so i 've been a registered voter since 2004 , and that 's the first time i cast an official ballot . king : how did it feel to vote ? russert : it felt great . it kind of felt like you became a man or at least an adult in some capacity . that your decision -- your decision -- became part of the country and its leadership . and i 'll never forget the way i voted was i was in college my freshman year , 2004 , so i had to go by absentee ballot . and i was going to meet my father in south bend , indiana , for the notre dame/boston college game . and i said , `` dad , i 'd rather you bring the ballot personally so it does n't have to go through the mail , send it up to me in boston . '' so he brought the ballot , and i filled out my absentee ballot in a south bend , indiana , hotel room , and he brought it back and put it right in the fedex for me . king : we have an e-mail question for you from david in cary , north carolina . `` luke , my condolences , '' it said . `` you 've shown great strength and character in recent days . any chance we 'll see you reporting or doing commentary about the 2008 election ? '' russert : oh yes , you just might . it 's something that i 'm definitely interested in . i think that i will probably be part of the peacock network . but you never know . i still have the sports show on xm radio and carville , and i kind of go into politics . but i would n't mind . king : what if cnn made a bid for you ? russert : i 'd be your assistant , larry ? king : you got it . you could come to work for us . i think i can speak for management . in fact , they 'll probably talk to you tomorrow based on just how well you 're handling yourself tonight . russert : well , i appreciate it . everyone has been so kind . i 'd love to have the opportunity to come out here and talk about something that is important to me . and it was important to my father , which was young people getting involved . that really is the important issue tonight . not me . that 's important .
749	harare , zimbabwe -lrb- cnn -rrb- -- zimbabwe 's opposition party said four of its activists and the wife of harare 's mayor -- an opposition member -- have been killed by supporters of president robert mugabe , just days ahead of next week 's presidential runoff . president robert mugabe says war veterans will take up arms again if tsvangirai wins . thursday 's report came as u.s. secretary of state condoleezza rice accused mugabe of sponsoring efforts to starve , beat and kill supporters of his opponent morgan tzvangirai so he can win the election . rice was speaking on the same day that tendai biti , the opposition movement for democratic change 's secretary-general , was charged with treason after being held in jail without charges for a week . if convicted , he could face the death penalty . his arrest and treason charges have been criticized by african and international leaders who characterize it as a ploy by mugabe supporters to intimidate the opposition party before his june 27 runoff against tsvangirai . a spokesman for the mdc blamed mugabe 's zanu-pf party for the five most recent deaths , saying they brought to 70 the number of mdc party members killed since a bitterly contested election three months ago . the body of the mayor 's wife , 27-year-old abigail chiroto , was found in a mortuary close to the couple 's house north of harare . she had been beaten so severely with rocks and iron bars that her face was almost unrecognizable , mdc spokesman nelson chamisa said . watch cnn 's nkepile mabuse report on the violience '' chiroto was kidnapped , along with her 4-year-old son , on tuesday . some of her kidnappers wore military uniforms , chamisa said . chiroto 's son was released unharmed . her husband , emmanuel chiroto , is an mdc member who was recently elected mayor of harare . he was not home at the time of the kidnapping . also thursday , the mdc said that four other activists were found dead in chitungwiza . the victims ' bodies showed evidence that `` they were heavily tortured until they died , '' an mdc statement said . `` it 's unbelievable the way people are being killed or murdered , '' chiroto said . `` it 's almost mass butchering . '' police confirmed the deaths of the activists but did not link the victims to any political party . mugabe 's party denied any part in the deaths , saying mdc officials made such accusations frequently . `` they are claiming anyone who dies . they phone cnn , '' said bright matonga , a zanu-pf spokesman . `` whenever someone dies in the hospital , they rush to claim them . '' matonga said harare was run by a commission . `` there is no mdc mayor in zimbabwe , '' he said . `` there is no newly elected mayor in harare . '' learn more about zimbabwe '' in new york , rice convened a meeting about the situation in zimbabwe at the united nations on thursday . `` mugabe is increasing violence against -lsb- the -rsb- opposition . ... president mugabe has squandered the promise of the very nation that was hailed as the jewel of africa , '' rice said at a roundtable discussion attended by representatives from many international governments . `` clearly we have reached a point where broader , stronger , international effort is needed , '' she added . on friday , a magistrate judge will determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with a trial against biti . the judge also will determine whether biti will be granted bail or will continue to be jailed until the trial . biti was charged thursday with treason , communicating false information prejudicial to the state , bringing the office of the president into disrepute and causing disaffection among armed forces , according to a journalist who was in the harare courtroom . he denies all the charges . watch biti arrive for his court hearing '' biti , wearing a red jacket and looking exhausted , held his head in his hands as the proceedings took place in the packed courtroom . `` i think that one must express very serious objection to the manner in which this whole case is being handled , '' said tsvangirai , who was in court . `` the accusations are frivolous . '' three of the charges stem from a document titled `` the transitional strategy , '' which biti is said to have written ahead of the march 29 election . biti is denying that he wrote the document , and his lawyers described it as `` doctored . '' the fourth charge of communicating falsehoods alleges that biti announced that tsvangirai had won the march presidential election by an outright majority , meaning no runoff vote would be needed . in recent weeks , opposition groups and churches have reported numerous cases of kidnappings , torture and other violence in the country targeting opponents of mugabe . zanu-pf members have been suspected of being behind the acts . zanu-pf claims that the mdc is behind the violence . it said mdc members attacked the mayor of kadoma , a city 140 km -lrb- 87 miles -rrb- southwest of harare . it also accused mdc activists of causing millions of dollars damage to private business . last week , mugabe warned that veterans he commanded in his country 's liberation war nearly three decades ago would take up arms again if tsvangirai won . watch an ad vilifying tsvangirai '' the mdc is using word of mouth and file-sharing sites such as youtube to disseminate its campaign advertisements , claiming that they are banned by state media . the group sent advertisements to supporters via e-mail , asking them to forward them to their friends and relatives . `` since the regime has denied the mdc access to state media , please send the adverts to as many people as you can , '' the e-mail says . `` a new zimbabwe is near . the dictator is finished . let 's finish it ! '' mugabe has been zimbabwe 's only leader since the war ended in 1980 but is blamed for the economic collapse of a country once considered a regional breadbasket . zimbabweans increasingly are unable to afford food and other essentials , with agriculture paralyzed by land reform and the world 's highest rate of inflation . police have arrested tsvangirai several times in the weeks leading up to the runoff , most recently on saturday , with 11 other officials and supporters from his party . south african president thabo mbeki met mugabe and tsvangirai on wednesday in the hope of quelling tensions . mbeki was visiting in his capacity as mediator with the 14-nation southern african development community , the south african government said wednesday . he is under domestic and international pressure for his perceived conciliatory stance toward mugabe , but the south african leader recently said he would continue his quiet diplomacy despite recent events . cnn 's nkepile mabuse contributed to this report .
